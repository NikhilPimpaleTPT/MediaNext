1
00:00:08,627 --> 00:00:11,127
What I’m hearing
repeatedly from our customers

2
00:00:11,128 --> 00:00:14,932
is that they’re looking for fewer,
more strategic relationships

3
00:00:15,779 --> 00:00:18,465
with their trusted partners
around the world.

4
00:00:18,895 --> 00:00:21,903
The incredible thing
about our organization,

5
00:00:22,241 --> 00:00:26,096
our unmatched breadth and depth
puts us in a position

6
00:00:26,097 --> 00:00:29,002
that we can be
one of those key strategic partners.

7
00:00:29,136 --> 00:00:32,101
Having a more
coordinated approach to market

8
00:00:32,102 --> 00:00:35,534
allows us to put our best foot
forward to our customers.

9
00:00:35,837 --> 00:00:40,333
It allows us to deliver
unparalleled customer experience.

10
00:00:40,505 --> 00:00:44,803
No other competitor has the assets,
the technology or the people,

11
00:00:45,076 --> 00:00:47,533
and we need
to share this with our customers.

12
00:00:47,869 --> 00:00:49,173
That’s what this is about.

13
00:00:49,478 --> 00:00:52,309
Today, in Thomson Reuters,
we have best practices

14
00:00:52,310 --> 00:00:54,467
that are sprinkled
across the organization

15
00:00:54,468 --> 00:00:55,687
in terms of going to market.

16
00:00:55,990 --> 00:00:58,966
If we were able to pull
all those best practices together,

17
00:00:59,318 --> 00:01:01,565
we would be a formidable force
in the marketplace.

18
00:01:01,642 --> 00:01:02,708
The biggest challenge for me

19
00:01:02,709 --> 00:01:05,083
with the way we currently
approach sales operations

20
00:01:05,197 --> 00:01:08,527
is that we do it in a vacuum.
We can’t get out of our own way.

21
00:01:08,548 --> 00:01:11,285
Right now, our reps
are spending entirely too much time

22
00:01:11,286 --> 00:01:13,927
on administrative tasks,
which is taking them away

23
00:01:13,928 --> 00:01:16,002
from spending time
where they should be spending it.

24
00:01:16,003 --> 00:01:17,212
Which is in front of our customers.

25
00:01:17,299 --> 00:01:21,107
Today, we do not get
a significant percentage of our leads

26
00:01:21,316 --> 00:01:23,540
through the demand generation
and marketing channel.

27
00:01:23,996 --> 00:01:26,500
Roughly 10 to 11 percent,
and that could be higher.

28
00:01:26,722 --> 00:01:29,102
I think a coordinated
go-to-market strategy for retention

29
00:01:29,103 --> 00:01:30,525
would be extremely compelling.

30
00:01:30,821 --> 00:01:32,392
It means our customers

31
00:01:32,393 --> 00:01:35,545
will derive much more value
from our platforms.

32
00:01:35,991 --> 00:01:37,997
It would mean that they’d
be able to navigate

33
00:01:38,261 --> 00:01:40,394
the uncertainty
in their respective businesses

34
00:01:40,395 --> 00:01:41,679
that they face nowadays.

35
00:01:42,105 --> 00:01:46,135
A coordinated global approach
to enterprise selling

36
00:01:46,236 --> 00:01:51,040
is a unique opportunity to grow
and to serve our customers better.

37
00:01:51,329 --> 00:01:55,223
We need to have a common vocabulary,
a common lexicon

38
00:01:55,564 --> 00:01:58,189
and a common way
of talking about customers.

39
00:01:58,434 --> 00:02:02,307
It’s really about developing
a common view of our customers

40
00:02:02,308 --> 00:02:04,974
and better understanding
what their needs are.

41
00:02:05,101 --> 00:02:09,857
Really, we want to show the world
that Thomson Reuters is by far

42
00:02:09,858 --> 00:02:14,651
the most global, the most scalable,
the most comprehensive solution

43
00:02:14,833 --> 00:02:19,201
and trusted partner for solving
our customers’ biggest problems.

44
00:02:19,509 --> 00:02:22,817
Our customers are asking for it,
our markets are demanding it.

45
00:02:23,264 --> 00:02:26,353
The difference for us
is being just successful,

46
00:02:26,354 --> 00:02:27,952
or being wildly successful.

47
00:02:28,397 --> 00:02:30,291
I think
there’s a profound responsibility

48
00:02:30,292 --> 00:02:33,375
that goes with the trust
our customers have in us.

49
00:02:33,988 --> 00:02:36,176
I take that very, very seriously.

50
00:02:37,078 --> 00:02:41,883
They are relying on us for the most
important questions they face

51
00:02:42,690 --> 00:02:45,755
and that carries with it
an obligation on our part,

52
00:02:46,304 --> 00:02:49,687
that we make sure
we get it absolutely right.

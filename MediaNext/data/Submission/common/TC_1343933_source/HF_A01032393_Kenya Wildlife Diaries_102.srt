8

{\an2}<i>those protecting</i>

9
00:00:25,158 --> 00:00:26,460
{\an2}<i>It's pointing right at us.</i>

10
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:30,898
{\an2}It's a dangerous job.

{\an2}<i>Africa is once again</i>

22

{\an8}targeting to poach
rhinos and elephants,

24

25
00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:32,252
{\an2}That's a huge, huge challenge to us.

26
00:02:36,290 --> 00:02:37,457
{\an2}It's a dangerous job.

{\an2}<i>Now they are in urgent danger.</i>

32
00:02:53,841 --> 00:02:56,143
{\an2}<i>In less than the lifespan</i>
<i>of a single animal,</i>

33
00:02:56,476 --> 00:02:59,012
{\an2}<i>both have been pushed</i>
<i>to the brink of extinction</i>

34

35

{\an2}<i>In effect, we are at war</i>
<i>with ourselves for their survival.</i>

36
00:03:08,922 --> 00:03:11,525
{\an2}<i>In the last poaching crisis</i>
<i>in the 1980's,</i>

37
00:03:11,959 --> 00:03:15,362
{\an2}<i>80% of the elephants</i>
<i>and 90% of the rhinos</i>

38
00:03:15,462 --> 00:03:16,763
{\an2}<i>were brutally slaughtered.</i>

39
00:03:18,198 --> 00:03:19,800
{\an2}<i>The elephants - for their ivory,</i>

40
00:03:19,867 --> 00:03:21,835
{\an2}<i>which was used</i>
<i>in decorative carvings.</i>

41
00:03:22,202 --> 00:03:23,871
{\an2}<i>The rhino for their horn,</i>

42
00:03:24,104 --> 00:03:26,206
{\an2}<i>used in traditional</i>
<i>Asian medicines.</i>

43
00:03:27,341 --> 00:03:29,776
{\an2}<i>It took aggressive</i>
<i>anti-poaching action,</i>

44
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:35,315
{\an2}<i>bolstered by a worldwide ban</i>
<i>on the sale of both ivory and rhino horn</i>

45
00:03:35,582 --> 00:03:37,284
{\an2}<i>to bring an end to the slaughter.</i>

46
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:40,020
{\an2}<i>But a renewed global black market</i>

47
00:03:40,087 --> 00:03:43,056
{\an2}<i>has once again</i>
<i>put Africa on the front lines.</i>

48
00:03:45,359 --> 00:03:48,595
{\an2}When you are talking
of rhino poaching,

49
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:50,797
{\an2}that is a syndicate.

50
00:03:51,598 --> 00:03:52,933
{\an2}You have main dealers

51
00:03:53,634 --> 00:03:55,602
{\an2}and you have the brokers between.

52
00:03:55,736 --> 00:03:57,104
{\an2}And then you have the gunmen,

53
00:03:57,171 --> 00:03:58,438
{\an2}the people on the ground.

54
00:03:58,939 --> 00:04:01,041
{\an2}Those are the people who
can kill these animals.

55
00:04:01,542 --> 00:04:02,910
{\an2}They are poor people.

56
00:04:03,043 --> 00:04:05,512
{\an2}They are people who are being killed.

57
00:04:05,913 --> 00:04:07,948
{\an2}So what I can just tell the poachers:

58
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:09,616
{\an2}don't risk yourself,

59
00:04:09,983 --> 00:04:13,520
{\an2}because we will bring
all the technology we can bring

60
00:04:13,654 --> 00:04:15,155
{\an2}to stop the poaching.

61
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:19,993
{\an2}<i>This is where Kenya's Lewa</i>
<i>Conservancy comes into play.</i>

62
00:04:20,827 --> 00:04:22,829
{\an2}<i>Sitting in the shadow of Mt. Kenya,</i>

63
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:26,600
{\an2}<i>it covers a modest area,</i>
<i>just twice the size of Paris,</i>

64
00:04:28,335 --> 00:04:32,239
{\an2}<i>Lewa is dedicated to protecting</i>
<i>critically endangered animals.</i>

65
00:04:32,973 --> 00:04:35,309
{\an2}<i>To ensure the rhino</i>
<i>and elephant's safety,</i>

66
00:04:35,642 --> 00:04:38,345
{\an2}<i>the conservancy is fenced</i>
<i>in on several sides.</i>

67
00:04:40,581 --> 00:04:42,182
{\an2}<i>On the front lines of the fight</i>

68
00:04:42,316 --> 00:04:44,418
{\an2}<i>is Lewa's team of armed rangers</i>

69
00:04:44,685 --> 00:04:46,186
{\an2}<i>who put their lives on the line</i>

70
00:04:46,253 --> 00:04:49,389
{\an2}<i>to ensure these species</i>
<i>don't disappear on their watch.</i>

71
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:55,095
{\an2}<i>The team at Lewa knows</i>
<i>that the battle against poaching</i>

72
00:04:55,162 --> 00:04:58,632
{\an2}<i>can't just be fought on the front lines</i>
<i>as an armed conflict.</i>

73
00:04:59,399 --> 00:05:01,702
{\an2}<i>The only way</i>
<i>these animals will survive</i>

74
00:05:01,835 --> 00:05:04,304
{\an2}<i>is to change the perception</i>
<i>of ordinary people</i>

75
00:05:04,471 --> 00:05:05,772
{\an2}<i>on a global scale</i>

76
00:05:06,373 --> 00:05:10,410
{\an2}<i>that these animals deserve</i>
<i>a safe and free place in the wild.</i>

77
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:14,481
{\an2}<i>If they fail,</i>
<i>these animals will go extinct.</i>

78
00:05:16,383 --> 00:05:21,421
{\an2}This rhino was shot dead
by someone in our village.

79
00:05:21,989 --> 00:05:23,257
{\an2}Our main question is

80
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:27,528
{\an2}are we happy to see skeletons,
skeletons of animals?

81
00:05:27,594 --> 00:05:29,663
{\an2}Or are we happy to see animals

82
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:32,599
{\an2}feeding, suckling their young ones.

83
00:05:33,267 --> 00:05:34,401
{\an2}That is my question.

84
00:05:44,011 --> 00:05:47,948
{\an2}<i>A single gunshot from a poacher</i>
<i>has enormous ramifications.</i>

85
00:05:49,383 --> 00:05:52,352
{\an2}<i>When a mother is killed,</i>
<i>the babies are left alive.</i>

86
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:55,289
{\an2}<i>In the wild</i>
<i>they are extremely vulnerable,</i>

87
00:05:55,522 --> 00:05:57,457
{\an2}<i>unable to take care of themselves,</i>

88
00:05:57,591 --> 00:05:59,760
{\an2}<i>and will quickly die or be killed.</i>

89
00:06:00,494 --> 00:06:03,463
{\an2}<i>However, orphaned animals</i>
<i>from all over Kenya</i>

90
00:06:03,597 --> 00:06:05,465
{\an2}<i>get a second chance at Lewa.</i>

91
00:06:09,303 --> 00:06:10,637
{\an2}This one 23 months,

92
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:12,873
{\an8}and this one 17 months,

93
00:06:13,407 --> 00:06:14,575
{\an2}and all boys.

94
00:06:14,942 --> 00:06:16,143
{\an2}The little one,

95
00:06:16,844 --> 00:06:18,478
{\an2}their mothers were
killed by poachers.

96
00:06:26,486 --> 00:06:28,889
{\an2}<i>Few conservancies have the capabilities,</i>

97
00:06:28,989 --> 00:06:31,024
{\an2}<i>or the resources to care for them.</i>

98
00:06:31,658 --> 00:06:35,329
{\an2}<i>It is a labour intensive,</i>
<i>expensive long term commitment.</i>

99
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:44,037
{\an2}<i>Lewa has caregivers who look after</i>
<i>and protect these young rhinos</i>

100
00:06:44,271 --> 00:06:45,572
{\an2}<i>24 hours a day.</i>

101
00:06:49,877 --> 00:06:51,879
{\an2}<i>The rhinos are</i>
<i>assigned a caregiver.</i>

102
00:06:54,281 --> 00:06:56,650
{\an2}<i>The young rhino</i>
<i>imprint on the rangers,</i>

103
00:06:57,317 --> 00:06:59,753
{\an2}<i>who effectively become</i>
<i>their surrogate mothers.</i>

104
00:07:00,287 --> 00:07:03,957
{\an2}<i>They will teach them the skills</i>
<i>they need to become wild rhinos again.</i>

105
00:07:04,892 --> 00:07:08,161
{\an2}<i>It's ironic that their lives</i>
<i>now depend on the species</i>

106
00:07:08,295 --> 00:07:09,930
{\an2}<i>that put them</i>
<i>in this predicament.</i>

107
00:07:09,997 --> 00:07:13,834
{\an2}We walk them around
1km every day.

108
00:07:16,503 --> 00:07:18,739
{\an2}<i>Their day mimics life in the wild.</i>

109
00:07:19,406 --> 00:07:20,841
{\an2}<i>Getting used to the new terrain</i>

110
00:07:20,908 --> 00:07:24,211
{\an2}<i>and covering important tasks</i>
<i>like personal hygiene.</i>

111
00:07:25,078 --> 00:07:26,513
{\an2}The climate is getting hot now.

112
00:07:26,713 --> 00:07:29,183
{\an2}So the rhinos are going
to have a mud bath.

113
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:31,985
{\an2}We actually have to take them
once a day.

114
00:07:58,679 --> 00:08:00,647
{\an2}Rhinos, they don't have sweat glands,

115
00:08:01,181 --> 00:08:03,584
{\an2}so they cool
their body temperatures down,

116
00:08:03,851 --> 00:08:06,520
{\an2}and also there are
some parasites like ticks

117
00:08:06,987 --> 00:08:09,289
{\an2}so when they cover
their body by the mud

118
00:08:09,556 --> 00:08:12,659
{\an2}and later on
they just rub against the tree

119
00:08:13,093 --> 00:08:14,561
{\an2}to remove the ticks off.

120
00:08:35,649 --> 00:08:38,952
{\an2}Kilif and Hope you can
release after 4 to 5 years.

121
00:08:39,586 --> 00:08:42,923
{\an2}<i>Raising a rhino here</i>
<i>at Lewa is a balancing act.</i>

122
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:45,125
{\an2}<i>These are not pets.</i>

123
00:08:45,859 --> 00:08:49,630
{\an2}<i>Keeping baby rhinos tame</i>
<i>to protect them is not a solution.</i>

124
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:53,534
{\an2}<i>It requires tremendous resources</i>
<i>to keep a captive animal,</i>

125
00:08:54,034 --> 00:08:56,870
{\an2}<i>especially ones that can</i>
<i>live into their forties.</i>

126
00:08:57,604 --> 00:09:00,307
{\an2}<i>And it's imperative</i>
<i>they be returned to the wild</i>

127
00:09:00,474 --> 00:09:02,109
{\an2}<i>to enrich the gene pool.</i>

128
00:09:06,647 --> 00:09:09,550
{\an2}<i>The rangers know they</i>
<i>will be releasing their little charges</i>

129
00:09:09,616 --> 00:09:11,919
{\an2}<i>into a world fraught with dangers.</i>

130
00:09:12,419 --> 00:09:14,955
{\an2}<i>And that includes</i>
<i>danger from poachers.</i>

131
00:09:17,658 --> 00:09:19,059
{\an2}<i>It's frustrating to them.</i>

132
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:21,395
{\an2}<i>Poaching is a human problem,</i>

133
00:09:21,595 --> 00:09:23,797
{\an2}<i>and it has to be stopped by humans.</i>

134
00:09:32,139 --> 00:09:34,208
{\an2}<i>Lewa's successful rhino program</i>

135
00:09:34,374 --> 00:09:36,710
{\an2}<i>is great news for conservation efforts.</i>

136
00:09:37,044 --> 00:09:39,479
{\an2}<i>But it's put</i>
<i>the conservancy and its staff</i>

137
00:09:39,546 --> 00:09:42,049
{\an2}<i>into a much more dangerous situation.</i>

138
00:09:43,884 --> 00:09:49,823
{\an2}When I started here in terms
of rhinos that was less than 20.

139
00:09:50,657 --> 00:09:54,661
{\an2}As we speak today
we have 135 rhinos.

140
00:09:55,195 --> 00:09:56,563
{\an2}There have been a lot of challenges

141
00:09:56,630 --> 00:09:58,565
{\an2}moving from security-wise

142
00:09:58,632 --> 00:10:02,402
{\an2}from less
than 20 security to 150 security.

143
00:10:03,604 --> 00:10:05,339
{\an2}Okay, Sawa Charlie,
we are coming back.

144
00:10:05,706 --> 00:10:08,742
{\an2}<i>The rangers are armed</i>
<i>with military grade weapons,</i>

145
00:10:09,042 --> 00:10:12,312
{\an2}<i>but anti poaching at Lewa</i>
<i>is not an offensive tool.</i>

146
00:10:12,746 --> 00:10:14,481
{\an2}<i>It's meant to deter poachers</i>

147
00:10:14,781 --> 00:10:17,918
{\an2}<i>and especially locals</i>
<i>who are often recruited by gangs</i>

148
00:10:17,985 --> 00:10:19,953
{\an2}<i>with the promise of a big pay day</i>

149
00:10:20,187 --> 00:10:23,257
{\an2}<i>that could be more money</i>
<i>that they'd see in a year.</i>

150
00:10:24,091 --> 00:10:27,427
{\an2}<i>So when head ranger John Pamori</i>
<i>is looking for new rangers,</i>

151
00:10:27,494 --> 00:10:29,396
{\an2}<i>he looks to the local communities</i>

152
00:10:30,097 --> 00:10:32,633
{\an2}In terms of recruitment in Lewa,

153
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:34,968
{\an2}when we are recruiting people

154
00:10:35,035 --> 00:10:37,137
{\an2}we target the communities around here.

155
00:10:37,437 --> 00:10:39,806
{\an2}<i>A steady job and a solid income</i>

156
00:10:39,873 --> 00:10:42,543
{\an2}<i>can mean one less person tempted</i>
<i>by the poaching money</i>

157
00:10:42,943 --> 00:10:46,813
{\an2}<i>and one more convert to seeing</i>
<i>healthy rhino and elephant populations</i>

158
00:10:46,914 --> 00:10:49,950
{\an2}<i>as a resource for the community,</i>
<i>worth protecting.</i>

159
00:10:55,789 --> 00:10:58,992
{\an2}<i>In Kenya, wildlife</i>
<i>conservancies, like Lewa,</i>

160
00:10:59,226 --> 00:11:00,661
{\an2}<i>have one central mission:</i>

161
00:11:01,395 --> 00:11:02,996
{\an2}<i>to provide a safe habitat</i>

162
00:11:03,063 --> 00:11:05,999
{\an2}<i>for the world's most vulnerable</i>
<i>and endangered creatures.</i>

163
00:11:08,202 --> 00:11:11,205
{\an2}<i>And now, they are dealing</i>
<i>with their most serious challenge.</i>

164
00:11:12,506 --> 00:11:15,342
{\an2}<i>With demand for illegal</i>
<i>ivory and rhino horn</i>

165
00:11:15,409 --> 00:11:16,777
{\an2}<i>skyrocketing in Asia</i>

166
00:11:17,244 --> 00:11:20,614
{\an2}<i>poaching is at its worst</i>
<i>level in over thirty years.</i>

167
00:11:22,916 --> 00:11:26,753
{\an2}<i>The government of Kenya</i>
<i>is taking this crisis very seriously.</i>

168
00:11:27,421 --> 00:11:30,524
{\an2}<i>It has imposed stiff penalties</i>
<i>for wildlife crimes.</i>

169
00:11:31,191 --> 00:11:33,260
{\an2}<i>The government works</i>
<i>closely with Lewa</i>

170
00:11:33,527 --> 00:11:35,863
{\an2}<i>and several other conservancies</i>
<i>in the region.</i>

171
00:11:36,597 --> 00:11:39,867
{\an2}<i>They have partnered up to create</i>
<i>an elite rapid response team.</i>

172
00:11:41,001 --> 00:11:43,637
{\an2}<i>The team is capable of dealing</i>
<i>with the growing threat,</i>

173
00:11:43,937 --> 00:11:47,541
{\an2}<i>not just to the conservancy</i>
<i>but all across northern Kenya.</i>

174
00:11:48,775 --> 00:11:53,313
{\an2}<i>It is well armed, well trained</i>
<i>and very well equipped.</i>

175
00:12:07,794 --> 00:12:09,429
{\an2}<i>The goal for this elite unit</i>

176
00:12:09,496 --> 00:12:12,733
{\an2}<i>is not to engage and destroy</i>
<i>the enemy on the front lines</i>

177
00:12:12,799 --> 00:12:13,967
{\an2}<i>in an all out war.</i>

178
00:12:15,068 --> 00:12:17,538
{\an2}<i>The hope is</i>
<i>that through a show of force,</i>

179
00:12:17,704 --> 00:12:19,873
{\an2}<i>they can deter</i>
<i>poachers completely.</i>

180
00:12:21,508 --> 00:12:25,445
{\an2}<i>But all the arms in the world</i>
<i>can't beat basic economics.</i>

181
00:12:26,313 --> 00:12:29,583
{\an2}<i>Ounce for ounce,</i>
<i>rhino horn is worth more than gold</i>

182
00:12:29,650 --> 00:12:30,984
{\an2}<i>in the underground market.</i>

183
00:12:31,552 --> 00:12:34,221
{\an2}<i>In a country where</i>
<i>poverty is a major issue</i>

184
00:12:34,621 --> 00:12:37,991
{\an2}<i>poaching pays 6 months salary</i>
<i>for a single day's work.</i>

185
00:12:38,926 --> 00:12:42,095
{\an2}<i>All you need is a gun</i>
<i>and an opportunity.</i>

186
00:12:43,497 --> 00:12:46,366
{\an2}<i>There are many people</i>
<i>who are willing to risk their lives</i>

187
00:12:46,433 --> 00:12:47,601
{\an2}<i>for that equation.</i>

188
00:12:48,502 --> 00:12:51,772
{\an2}<i>With severe penalties</i>
<i>for poaching rhino or elephants</i>

189
00:12:51,972 --> 00:12:54,775
{\an2}<i>the poachers</i>
<i>are desperate not to get caught.</i>

190
00:12:55,108 --> 00:12:57,344
{\an2}<i>They won't hesitate to kill a ranger,</i>

191
00:12:57,611 --> 00:13:00,881
{\an2}<i>and that desperation</i>
<i>adds another level of danger.</i>

192
00:13:01,148 --> 00:13:02,716
{\an2}We have different firearms here.

193
00:13:02,983 --> 00:13:05,018
{\an2}This one is from the government,

194
00:13:05,452 --> 00:13:07,821
{\an2}being issued to our armed teams.

195
00:13:08,655 --> 00:13:12,059
{\an2}<i>The Elite team members</i>
<i>don't have backgrounds in the military.</i>

196
00:13:13,026 --> 00:13:16,163
{\an2}<i>But they have outside partners</i>
<i>who provide regular training.</i>

197
00:13:27,975 --> 00:13:29,142
{\an2}<i>The Kenyan government</i>

198
00:13:29,209 --> 00:13:31,245
{\an2}<i>has accepted help</i>
<i>from the British Forces,</i>

199
00:13:31,745 --> 00:13:33,914
{\an2}<i>who have sent experts</i>
<i>to help train the rangers</i>

200
00:13:33,981 --> 00:13:37,017
{\an2}<i>on advanced engagement</i>
<i>and capture techniques.</i>

201
00:13:39,319 --> 00:13:40,554
{\an2}<i>Tonight's exercise</i>

202
00:13:40,621 --> 00:13:43,891
{\an2}<i>will include the latest in aerial</i>
<i>and ground technology.</i>

203
00:13:44,992 --> 00:13:48,262
{\an2}The poaching gangs
are becoming ever more sophisticated

204
00:13:48,595 --> 00:13:49,930
{\an2}with the money that's involved in it.

205
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:54,668
{\an8}Through the 90's there was
a relatively quiet period.

206
00:13:56,170 --> 00:13:58,739
{\an8}That now has
escalated dramatically

207
00:13:58,805 --> 00:14:02,743
{\an2}because of the escalation
in the price of rhino horn

208
00:14:02,809 --> 00:14:04,545
{\an2}in the Far East
and the demand there.

209
00:14:06,446 --> 00:14:11,084
{\an2}So it's been
about as bad as its ever been

210
00:14:11,318 --> 00:14:13,520
{\an2}these last four, five years.

211
00:14:13,887 --> 00:14:15,822
{\an2}Let's just bring the scope back a bit.

212
00:14:16,056 --> 00:14:18,392
{\an2}We'll head off that way
and then cut back this way.

213
00:14:18,525 --> 00:14:19,526
{\an2}Happy hunting!

214
00:14:21,762 --> 00:14:22,863
{\an2}Watch your feet.

215
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:26,900
{\an2}<i>Sam, a training specialist,</i>
<i>leads a small team,</i>

216
00:14:27,301 --> 00:14:28,902
{\an2}<i>playing the role of poachers.</i>

217
00:14:29,503 --> 00:14:31,572
{\an2}<i>They'll emulate the real thing:</i>

218
00:14:33,006 --> 00:14:35,909
{\an2}<i>skilled, fast and difficult to catch.</i>

219
00:14:37,277 --> 00:14:41,715
{\an2}The poachers appear to be
incredibly fast at getting a horn off,

220
00:14:41,782 --> 00:14:44,484
{\an2}which is why
this training is so important.

221
00:14:44,551 --> 00:14:47,521
{\an2}It's hopefully keeping us
one step ahead of the game.

222
00:14:47,754 --> 00:14:50,057
{\an2}<i>In this exercise the poaching team</i>

223
00:14:50,123 --> 00:14:53,727
{\an2}<i>stays put as long as it would take</i>
<i>for a poacher to cut off a rhino horn.</i>

224
00:14:54,361 --> 00:14:57,431
{\an2}And what we're going to do
is fire off a few shots

225
00:14:57,497 --> 00:14:59,299
{\an2}as though we were cutting off a horn

226
00:14:59,733 --> 00:15:03,303
{\an2}and then move out as though unaware
that we had been located.

227
00:15:04,104 --> 00:15:05,305
{\an2}Okay, go.

228
00:15:21,021 --> 00:15:23,657
{\an2}There's the various scenes here...
they'll try to pinpoint it,

229
00:15:24,491 --> 00:15:27,761
{\an2}and now they're in the process
of setting up ambushes.

230
00:15:28,595 --> 00:15:30,697
{\an2}Okay,
we're going to start moving west now.

231
00:15:30,764 --> 00:15:32,366
{\an2}Okay guys, we're going to move on.

232
00:15:33,667 --> 00:15:35,169
{\an2}<i>Once a shot is fired,</i>

233
00:15:35,235 --> 00:15:37,504
{\an2}<i>it will take an average</i>
<i>of about 40 minutes</i>

234
00:15:37,571 --> 00:15:39,072
{\an2}<i>to escape the conservancy.</i>

235
00:15:40,707 --> 00:15:42,576
{\an2}<i>An eternity for the poacher...</i>

236
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:45,612
{\an2}<i>the blink of an eye for the ranger team.</i>

237
00:15:48,649 --> 00:15:50,184
{\an2}Cameraman you follow him.

238
00:15:55,122 --> 00:15:57,891
{\an2}We're just carrying on...
heading to the north.

239
00:16:02,696 --> 00:16:04,164
{\an2}<i>They look for cover.</i>

240
00:16:08,402 --> 00:16:11,939
{\an2}<i>But the point of this exercise</i>
<i>is to provide no place to hide.</i>

241
00:16:15,909 --> 00:16:17,144
{\an2}<i>Okay, guys.</i>

242
00:16:19,780 --> 00:16:21,415
{\an2}They got the laser on us now.

243
00:16:22,382 --> 00:16:25,352
{\an2}<i>The use of the chopper</i>
<i>provides a strong advantage.</i>

244
00:16:29,456 --> 00:16:32,059
{\an2}<i>It can pinpoint the enemy,</i>
<i>follow them,</i>

245
00:16:32,125 --> 00:16:34,661
{\an2}<i>and communicate</i>
<i>their position to the ground crew.</i>

246
00:16:34,728 --> 00:16:36,196
{\an2}They're pointing
right at us.

247
00:16:36,897 --> 00:16:39,066
{\an2}So the guys can see a beam
from further away.

248
00:16:42,336 --> 00:16:45,639
{\an2}<i>With an aircraft, they can</i>
<i>push the poachers to an ambush</i>

249
00:16:45,873 --> 00:16:49,209
{\an2}<i>making it easier for the rangers</i>
<i>on the ground to nab them.</i>

250
00:16:54,915 --> 00:16:57,317
{\an2}<i>As a bonus,</i>
<i>the shock and awe factor</i>

251
00:16:57,384 --> 00:16:59,453
{\an2}<i>sends a clear signal for miles,</i>

252
00:17:01,121 --> 00:17:03,056
{\an2}<i>Lewa's defences are active.</i>

253
00:17:20,174 --> 00:17:21,275
{\an2}Okay.

254
00:17:25,245 --> 00:17:26,246
{\an2}Are we dead?

255
00:17:27,047 --> 00:17:29,883
{\an2}<i>The poachers</i>
<i>in this exercise are taken alive,</i>

256
00:17:30,017 --> 00:17:31,618
{\an2}<i>which is an important tactic.</i>

257
00:17:33,187 --> 00:17:34,888
{\an2}<i>If one of the poachers is killed,</i>

258
00:17:35,022 --> 00:17:37,324
{\an2}<i>then another one</i>
<i>will simply take his place.</i>

259
00:17:38,158 --> 00:17:39,660
{\an2}<i>But if taken alive</i>

260
00:17:39,726 --> 00:17:41,962
{\an2}<i>they could lead</i>
<i>the investigation to the middlemen.</i>

261
00:17:43,230 --> 00:17:44,798
{\an2}I got a blank right in the ear.

262
00:17:46,233 --> 00:17:49,036
{\an2}They did really well.
Good. Well organized.

263
00:18:00,047 --> 00:18:03,150
{\an2}<i>If under pressure,</i>
<i>poachers have two options.</i>

264
00:18:03,617 --> 00:18:05,986
{\an2}<i>Make a run for it,</i>
<i>or wait and hide.</i>

265
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:07,855
{\an2}<i>If they choose to hide</i>

266
00:18:07,988 --> 00:18:10,591
{\an2}<i>even a helicopter may</i>
<i>not be able to find them.</i>

267
00:18:11,458 --> 00:18:15,195
{\an2}<i>For that scenario Lewa</i>
<i>also has a less high tech solution.</i>

268
00:18:15,696 --> 00:18:18,298
{\an8}We have
these two bloodhounds here.

269
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:23,136
{\an8}They assist
in tracking poachers.

270
00:18:23,403 --> 00:18:26,940
{\an2}In the course of their duties
they work in pack environments.

271
00:18:30,777 --> 00:18:32,379
{\an2}<i>Like their human counterparts,</i>

272
00:18:32,613 --> 00:18:35,682
{\an2}<i>these dogs require constant</i>
<i>honing of their skills.</i>

273
00:18:44,892 --> 00:18:47,995
{\an8}Today we are doing
an exercise with tracker dogs.

274
00:18:49,062 --> 00:18:51,164
{\an2}We are going to send
a poacher first.

275
00:18:51,365 --> 00:18:53,800
{\an2}Then we are going to track
and also test the dogs.

276
00:18:54,101 --> 00:18:56,136
{\an2}Yeah, every day you have
to use a new person,

277
00:18:56,203 --> 00:18:57,304
{\an2}because you know for the dogs

278
00:18:57,371 --> 00:18:59,339
{\an2}it has to be get used
to a different scent.

279
00:18:59,406 --> 00:19:02,009
{\an2}Because if you use
the same person for every day

280
00:19:02,276 --> 00:19:03,310
{\an2}it will be the same scent.

281
00:19:03,377 --> 00:19:04,611
{\an2}Now we are putting the harness on,

282
00:19:04,678 --> 00:19:06,513
{\an2}the dog will realize
it's working time now.

283
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:16,924
{\an2}<i>Bloodhounds were originally bred</i>
<i>as deer hunting dogs,</i>

284
00:19:17,758 --> 00:19:20,327
{\an2}<i>but they are</i>
<i>equally apt at tracking humans.</i>

285
00:19:24,231 --> 00:19:27,100
{\an2}<i>With 200 million olfactory receptors,</i>

286
00:19:27,301 --> 00:19:29,369
{\an2}<i>compared to 5 million for humans,</i>

287
00:19:29,636 --> 00:19:32,372
{\an2}<i>these dogs are built</i>
<i>for one specific task,</i>

288
00:19:32,439 --> 00:19:33,907
{\an2}<i>and they don't disappoint.</i>

289
00:19:44,151 --> 00:19:45,619
{\an2}<i>As part of the exercise,</i>

290
00:19:45,686 --> 00:19:48,422
{\an2}<i>a scouting plane</i>
<i>will try to provoke the poachers.</i>

291
00:19:58,131 --> 00:19:59,766
{\an2}<i>If anyone gets in their way,</i>

292
00:20:00,167 --> 00:20:02,903
{\an2}<i>poachers often make</i>
<i>the mistake of firing their weapons,</i>

293
00:20:03,136 --> 00:20:04,705
{\an2}<i>in an attempt to intimidate.</i>

294
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:09,376
{\an2}<i>But this only draws the dogs in,</i>

295
00:20:11,545 --> 00:20:13,780
{\an2}<i>and then it's just a matter of time.</i>

296
00:20:49,016 --> 00:20:51,151
{\an2}<i>These "poachers" can walk away.</i>

297
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:55,355
{\an2}<i>But Lewa's most valuable</i>
<i>domestic species</i>

298
00:20:55,422 --> 00:20:57,257
{\an2}<i>is ready for the real thing.</i>

299
00:21:03,363 --> 00:21:06,500
{\an2}<i>It's another busy day</i>
<i>at Kenya's Lewa Conservancy.</i>

300
00:21:07,234 --> 00:21:09,303
{\an2}<i>In this current climate</i>
<i>of aggressive poaching,</i>

301
00:21:09,670 --> 00:21:12,005
{\an2}<i>rangers constantly</i>
<i>monitor the welfare</i>

302
00:21:12,139 --> 00:21:14,508
{\an2}<i>of all the conservancy's</i>
<i>endangered animals.</i>

303
00:21:20,314 --> 00:21:22,382
{\an2}<i>A report has come</i>
<i>in that a young elephant</i>

304
00:21:22,449 --> 00:21:26,153
{\an2}<i>has entered the conservancy</i>
<i>with a wire snare around it's leg.</i>

305
00:21:32,826 --> 00:21:35,696
{\an2}<i>It's of great concern</i>
<i>to head Ranger Chilimo.</i>

306
00:21:36,830 --> 00:21:40,300
{\an2}<i>He has called in the Kenyan</i>
<i>Wildlife Service Mobile Vet Unit</i>

307
00:21:40,601 --> 00:21:41,802
{\an2}<i>based at Lewa.</i>

308
00:21:44,137 --> 00:21:47,140
{\an2}<i>This elephant is lucky</i>
<i>that it was spotted by rangers.</i>

309
00:21:47,541 --> 00:21:49,743
{\an2}<i>If it had not walked</i>
<i>into the conservancy,</i>

310
00:21:49,943 --> 00:21:51,512
{\an2}<i>and right past the rangers,</i>

311
00:21:51,778 --> 00:21:54,548
{\an2}<i>it is likely the snare</i>
<i>would not have been reported.</i>

312
00:21:55,315 --> 00:21:57,584
{\an2}<i>The wire would have dug</i>
<i>into the elephant's leg</i>

313
00:21:57,818 --> 00:21:59,653
{\an2}<i>creating a painful infection.</i>

314
00:22:00,387 --> 00:22:02,189
{\an2}<i>Untreated the young elephant</i>

315
00:22:02,256 --> 00:22:04,291
{\an2}<i>would have died</i>
<i>an agonizing death.</i>

316
00:22:05,526 --> 00:22:07,694
{\an2}<i>The drug won't put</i>
<i>the animal to sleep,</i>

317
00:22:08,128 --> 00:22:11,098
{\an2}<i>it will just immobilize it</i>
<i>so the team can work safely.</i>

318
00:22:12,633 --> 00:22:14,168
{\an2}<i>The team is lucky.</i>

319
00:22:14,735 --> 00:22:16,537
{\an2}<i>Even though</i>
<i>these elephants are wild,</i>

320
00:22:16,803 --> 00:22:19,406
{\an2}<i>they're habituated</i>
<i>and don't mind the vehicles.</i>

321
00:22:19,973 --> 00:22:21,441
{\an2}So we are just preparing a dart,

322
00:22:21,708 --> 00:22:23,577
{\an2}to immobilize an elephant

323
00:22:23,644 --> 00:22:27,881
{\an2}to remove a snare
on its right hind foot.

324
00:22:28,315 --> 00:22:30,083
{\an2}We have to remove it because it's-

325
00:22:30,751 --> 00:22:32,686
{\an2}it will tighten as it goes along,

326
00:22:33,787 --> 00:22:35,856
{\an2}and it can even cause
very serious wounds.

327
00:22:51,738 --> 00:22:54,241
{\an2}<i>The vet team begins</i>
<i>to push the mother off.</i>

328
00:22:57,311 --> 00:22:59,546
{\an2}<i>The risk to the team is enormous</i>

329
00:23:00,047 --> 00:23:01,849
{\an2}<i>nothing is more dangerous</i>

330
00:23:01,915 --> 00:23:04,751
{\an2}<i>then getting</i>
<i>between a wild elephant and her baby.</i>

331
00:23:11,491 --> 00:23:13,160
{\an2}<i>The elephant is now down.</i>

332
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:28,108
{\an2}<i>The mother looks on.</i>

333
00:23:28,575 --> 00:23:30,744
{\an2}<i>She is confused and agitated</i>

334
00:23:31,245 --> 00:23:33,213
{\an2}<i>but is holding</i>
<i>back at a distance.</i>

335
00:23:34,214 --> 00:23:36,984
{\an2}<i>But at any moment</i>
<i>her instincts could kick in</i>

336
00:23:37,150 --> 00:23:38,619
{\an2}<i>and she could charge the team.</i>

337
00:23:38,919 --> 00:23:40,854
{\an2}They are just
about 200 meters from us.

338
00:23:42,589 --> 00:23:45,192
{\an2}<i>It remains a volatile situation.</i>

339
00:23:57,604 --> 00:23:59,072
{\an2}<i>The wire is removed.</i>

340
00:23:59,573 --> 00:24:02,809
{\an2}<i>It turns out to be a piece of fence</i>
<i>wrapped around the baby's leg,</i>

341
00:24:03,777 --> 00:24:05,479
{\an2}<i>and not a poacher's snare.</i>

342
00:24:06,346 --> 00:24:07,681
{\an2}<i>Its good news</i>

343
00:24:08,248 --> 00:24:10,784
{\an2}<i>but still poses</i>
<i>the same danger to the animal</i>

344
00:24:10,918 --> 00:24:12,886
{\an2}<i>so it was crucial it was removed.</i>

345
00:24:13,687 --> 00:24:15,355
{\an2}So we are not going
keep her any longer.

346
00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:23,230
{\an2}<i>The Kenyan Wildlife vet</i>
<i>administers the antidote.</i>

347
00:24:24,331 --> 00:24:26,333
{\an2}But it's ok.
It looks stable.

348
00:24:32,606 --> 00:24:33,640
{\an2}I'm sure they are waiting

349
00:24:37,211 --> 00:24:39,513
{\an2}<i>The little elephant</i>
<i>begins to come around.</i>

350
00:25:21,355 --> 00:25:23,457
{\an2}<i>After a moment</i>
<i>to get its orientation,</i>

351
00:25:23,690 --> 00:25:26,860
{\an2}<i>it shakes off the drug,</i>
<i>and goes back to it's family.</i>

352
00:25:27,995 --> 00:25:29,463
{\an2}<i>The group moves on.</i>

353
00:25:37,037 --> 00:25:40,274
{\an2}<i>Back at the Headquarters,</i>
<i>their elephant troubles continue.</i>

354
00:25:41,642 --> 00:25:43,410
{\an2}<i>An urgent call comes in.</i>

355
00:25:44,111 --> 00:25:45,779
{\an2}<i>The details are sketchy.</i>

356
00:25:46,446 --> 00:25:50,684
{\an2}<i>They're told that an elephant</i>
<i>has been shot and severely injured</i>

357
00:25:50,817 --> 00:25:53,587
{\an2}<i>in a village three hours</i>
<i>outside of the conservancy.</i>

358
00:25:54,788 --> 00:25:57,057
{\an2}<i>A full elite team is dispatched.</i>

359
00:25:57,724 --> 00:26:00,227
{\an2}<i>Once they're outside</i>
<i>the boundaries of the conservancy</i>

360
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:01,828
{\an2}<i>all bets are off</i>

361
00:26:02,396 --> 00:26:04,665
{\an2}<i>they have to be</i>
<i>prepared for anything.</i>

362
00:26:07,801 --> 00:26:11,038
{\an2}<i>For Kenyan Wildlife Service</i>
<i>head vet Mathew Mutinda,</i>

363
00:26:11,371 --> 00:26:12,773
{\an2}<i>it's a different story.</i>

364
00:26:13,407 --> 00:26:15,275
{\an2}<i>His concern is for the animal.</i>

365
00:26:15,609 --> 00:26:19,179
{\an2}We're going to investigate
and decide a course of action.

366
00:26:19,646 --> 00:26:22,416
{\an2}If it's a treatable case
we are going to fix it.

367
00:26:28,856 --> 00:26:31,558
{\an2}<i>As they approach,</i>
<i>the mood gets somber.</i>

368
00:26:34,428 --> 00:26:37,831
{\an2}<i>A Kenyan Wildlife Service</i>
<i>ranger unit is waiting for them.</i>

369
00:26:46,573 --> 00:26:48,242
{\an2}<i>They lead Mathew</i>
<i>to the elephant.</i>

370
00:26:56,950 --> 00:26:58,986
{\an2}<i>This is where the elephant was shot,</i>

371
00:27:00,988 --> 00:27:02,356
{\an2}<i>it collapsed here,</i>

372
00:27:02,523 --> 00:27:04,391
{\an2}<i>and crawled to where it now lays.</i>

373
00:27:20,073 --> 00:27:22,376
{\an2}<i>This is everyone's</i>
<i>worst fear.</i>

374
00:27:24,278 --> 00:27:26,213
{\an2}<i>The elephant is in agony.</i>

375
00:27:28,081 --> 00:27:30,284
{\an2}The guys heard a shot yesterday

376
00:27:30,651 --> 00:27:32,586
{\an2}and they
came to investigate the shot

377
00:27:32,653 --> 00:27:33,854
{\an2}and they found an elephant.

378
00:27:34,555 --> 00:27:36,290
{\an2}<i>Even for Matthew and the team</i>

379
00:27:36,356 --> 00:27:38,492
{\an2}<i>who are used to seeing</i>
<i>animals in distress,</i>

380
00:27:38,759 --> 00:27:40,961
{\an2}<i>this is an awful experience.</i>

381
00:27:43,030 --> 00:27:45,265
{\an2}<i>Mathew</i>
<i>will have to make a quick decision.</i>

382
00:27:53,740 --> 00:27:55,342
{\an2}The animal
is obviously suffering.

383
00:27:55,409 --> 00:27:57,811
{\an2}It's welfare
it's in a lot of pain

384
00:27:58,111 --> 00:28:02,816
{\an2}and you can clearly see where
there is an entry wound.

385
00:28:17,397 --> 00:28:18,398
{\an2}Sawa.

386
00:28:19,066 --> 00:28:21,702
{\an2}<i>For Mathew, the decision is obvious.</i>

387
00:28:24,671 --> 00:28:26,607
{\an2}<i>It won't be a happy ending.</i>

388
00:28:31,578 --> 00:28:32,679
{\an2}It's terrible.

389
00:28:32,746 --> 00:28:34,715
{\an2}It's terrible...
it's bad enough... it's broken.

390
00:28:34,848 --> 00:28:36,283
{\an2}This is really bad to happen.

391
00:28:36,350 --> 00:28:39,253
{\an2}Unfortunately we have to put it down,
but we can't show it on camera.

392
00:28:39,319 --> 00:28:41,388
{\an2}It's got to be done
with respect for the animal,

393
00:28:41,522 --> 00:28:43,991
{\an2}and now we have to request
that you guys have to leave

394
00:28:44,057 --> 00:28:45,125
{\an2}so that we can do that.

395
00:28:48,228 --> 00:28:50,964
{\an2}<i>For Chilimo this is a terrible irony</i>

396
00:28:52,633 --> 00:28:54,334
{\an2}<i>he came here to save an animal</i>

397
00:28:54,568 --> 00:28:57,471
{\an2}<i>but will now have to kill</i>
<i>one to end it's suffering.</i>

398
00:29:01,408 --> 00:29:03,177
{\an2}<i>However before he does.</i>

399
00:29:03,644 --> 00:29:05,679
{\an2}<i>The animal succumbs to its injuries.</i>

400
00:29:10,517 --> 00:29:13,754
{\an2}<i>The rangers see death</i>
<i>of animals on a regular basis.</i>

401
00:29:14,154 --> 00:29:16,857
{\an2}<i>But this does not make</i>
<i>this any easier for them.</i>

402
00:29:17,591 --> 00:29:19,359
{\an2}<i>They take the loss to heart.</i>

403
00:29:23,864 --> 00:29:25,866
{\an2}<i>With the agony of the animal over,</i>

404
00:29:26,133 --> 00:29:28,569
{\an2}<i>the job now shifts to an investigation.</i>

405
00:29:30,804 --> 00:29:33,340
{\an2}<i>Rangers learn the shooter</i>
<i>is from the community</i>

406
00:29:35,342 --> 00:29:37,077
{\an2}<i>and they want to question him.</i>

407
00:29:43,884 --> 00:29:47,521
{\an2}<i>The death of an elephant is</i>
<i>taken very seriously in Kenya.</i>

408
00:29:49,289 --> 00:29:53,060
{\an2}<i>If this is poaching the shooter</i>
<i>could face life in prison.</i>

409
00:30:02,269 --> 00:30:05,105
{\an2}<i>Unfortunately there is more bad news</i>

410
00:30:05,873 --> 00:30:09,009
{\an2}<i>the team from Lewa learns</i>
<i>the elephant had a young baby.</i>

411
00:30:10,777 --> 00:30:12,913
{\an2}<i>In the hours after the mother was shot,</i>

412
00:30:13,113 --> 00:30:15,983
{\an2}<i>the baby was left</i>
<i>unprotected and vulnerable.</i>

413
00:30:17,818 --> 00:30:21,088
{\an2}<i>It was killed and eaten</i>
<i>by hyenas this morning.</i>

414
00:30:25,092 --> 00:30:27,861
{\an2}<i>It's tragic to think</i>
<i>that although gravely wounded,</i>

415
00:30:27,995 --> 00:30:30,163
{\an2}<i>she managed</i>
<i>to outlive her baby.</i>

416
00:30:40,174 --> 00:30:42,910
{\an2}<i>In a wildlife conservancy</i>
<i>like Kenya's Lewa,</i>

417
00:30:43,243 --> 00:30:44,711
{\an2}<i>there are a lot of good days</i>

418
00:30:44,778 --> 00:30:46,947
{\an2}<i>when efforts to protect</i>
<i>endangered wildlife</i>

419
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:50,684
{\an2}<i>are rewarded by the beautiful</i>
<i>quiet of an African plain.</i>

420
00:30:51,618 --> 00:30:54,354
{\an2}<i>But today has not been</i>
<i>one of those days.</i>

421
00:30:54,488 --> 00:30:56,390
{\an2}I was ready to euthanize the animal

422
00:30:56,456 --> 00:30:58,559
{\an2}because it was
in pain on welfare grounds

423
00:30:58,926 --> 00:31:00,961
{\an2}but before I did
that the animal died.

424
00:31:03,230 --> 00:31:06,333
{\an2}<i>Even for the veterans,</i>
<i>this was a tough one.</i>

425
00:31:07,301 --> 00:31:10,003
{\an2}<i>Now it's time to get</i>
<i>to the bottom of what happened.</i>

426
00:31:14,441 --> 00:31:17,144
{\an2}<i>Penalties for poaching</i>
<i>in Kenya are severe.</i>

427
00:31:18,378 --> 00:31:21,448
{\an2}<i>In this case the shooter is</i>
<i>not denying he shot the animal,</i>

428
00:31:21,849 --> 00:31:23,817
{\an2}<i>but claims it was self-defence.</i>

429
00:31:24,318 --> 00:31:26,587
{\an2}It's hard to say
until you do a postmortem

430
00:31:26,653 --> 00:31:28,055
{\an2}and retrieve the bullet.

431
00:31:28,689 --> 00:31:31,258
{\an2}<i>It's tough to know</i>
<i>what his intentions were.</i>

432
00:31:32,059 --> 00:31:34,294
{\an2}<i>The facts are that several</i>
<i>community members</i>

433
00:31:34,361 --> 00:31:37,698
{\an2}<i>responded to the gun shot,</i>
<i>and reported it authorities.</i>

434
00:31:38,765 --> 00:31:42,269
{\an2}<i>But the shooter did not make</i>
<i>any attempt to report it himself.</i>

435
00:31:43,704 --> 00:31:45,873
{\an2}<i>So they're left with the question</i>

436
00:31:46,473 --> 00:31:48,141
{\an2}<i>Is the shooter telling the truth</i>

437
00:31:48,642 --> 00:31:51,078
{\an2}<i>or did he simply come</i>
<i>across an elephant</i>

438
00:31:51,211 --> 00:31:53,046
{\an2}<i>and decide to take advantage.</i>

439
00:31:53,881 --> 00:31:56,416
{\an2}<i>The rangers fear</i>
<i>this opportunistic shooting</i>

440
00:31:56,517 --> 00:31:59,353
{\an2}<i>represents a growing trend</i>
<i>in poaching in Kenya.</i>

441
00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:04,024
{\an2}<i>These one-off shooters know</i>
<i>they can access low level brokers</i>

442
00:32:04,291 --> 00:32:06,760
{\an2}<i>who then supply</i>
<i>more organized poaching rings</i>

443
00:32:06,894 --> 00:32:08,395
{\an2}<i>to move the ivory out.</i>

444
00:32:09,396 --> 00:32:11,398
{\an2}Each town you have a broker

445
00:32:12,165 --> 00:32:15,502
{\an2}they are people just sitting
waiting to be delivered.

446
00:32:16,970 --> 00:32:21,108
{\an2}<i>If they get caught,</i>
<i>the penalty means serious jail time.</i>

447
00:32:22,509 --> 00:32:25,312
{\an2}<i>But still some feel</i>
<i>that the financial windfall</i>

448
00:32:25,746 --> 00:32:26,947
{\an2}<i>is worth the risk.</i>

449
00:32:27,314 --> 00:32:30,817
{\an2}Most of the time it's
so difficult to get.

450
00:32:31,118 --> 00:32:32,819
{\an2}In terms of arresting somebody,

451
00:32:32,886 --> 00:32:36,190
{\an2}you might not be able
to arrest someone red handed.

452
00:32:37,791 --> 00:32:39,526
{\an2}<i>If they are not</i>
<i>caught in the act,</i>

453
00:32:40,027 --> 00:32:43,330
{\an2}<i>they can return under the cover</i>
<i>of darkness to remove the tusks.</i>

454
00:32:44,398 --> 00:32:47,634
{\an2}<i>Unfortunately this is</i>
<i>not a clear cut case,</i>

455
00:32:48,135 --> 00:32:50,671
{\an2}<i>and will likely take months</i>
<i>to go through the courts.</i>

456
00:32:52,706 --> 00:32:54,174
{\an2}Tighten, tighten, tighten

457
00:32:55,776 --> 00:32:57,878
{\an2}<i>KWS vet Mathew Mutinda</i>

458
00:32:58,011 --> 00:33:01,181
{\an2}<i>is about to carry out a forensic</i>
<i>post-mortem on the animal.</i>

459
00:33:07,721 --> 00:33:09,423
{\an2}<i>The bullet needs to be retrieved</i>

460
00:33:09,489 --> 00:33:11,758
{\an2}<i>to make sure it corroborates</i>
<i>with the shooter's story,</i>

461
00:33:12,025 --> 00:33:13,694
{\an2}<i>and matches the weapon used.</i>

462
00:33:14,228 --> 00:33:16,630
{\an2}<i>If not, there could be others involved.</i>

463
00:33:17,164 --> 00:33:18,866
{\an2}In the process
of doing a post-mortem

464
00:33:18,966 --> 00:33:21,301
{\an2}I was able to retrieve the projectile.

465
00:33:22,202 --> 00:33:25,372
{\an2}We do not have any indication
where the bullet would have come from,

466
00:33:25,506 --> 00:33:27,841
{\an2}and investigations
are going to go on.

467
00:33:32,646 --> 00:33:36,817
{\an2}<i>The rangers now must face</i>
<i>the grim task of removing the tusks.</i>

468
00:33:39,219 --> 00:33:40,454
{\an2}<i>Unlike de-tusking</i>

469
00:33:40,521 --> 00:33:42,556
{\an2}<i>where a section of the tusk is removed,</i>

470
00:33:42,890 --> 00:33:46,927
{\an2}<i>here the tusks, which extend deep</i>
<i>into the skull, must be cut out.</i>

471
00:33:47,661 --> 00:33:49,530
{\an2}<i>The ivory will be sent to Nairobi</i>

472
00:33:49,696 --> 00:33:52,032
{\an2}<i>where it will be placed</i>
<i>in an ivory strong room.</i>

473
00:33:52,799 --> 00:33:55,469
{\an2}<i>What will happen to them</i>
<i>long-term is unknown.</i>

474
00:33:56,670 --> 00:33:59,406
{\an2}<i>Kenya has a history</i>
<i>of burning illegal ivory,</i>

475
00:33:59,973 --> 00:34:02,743
{\an2}<i>but with stockpiles being</i>
<i>worth millions of dollars</i>

476
00:34:02,876 --> 00:34:05,345
{\an2}<i>some countries are</i>
<i>hesitant to destroy them.</i>

477
00:34:06,079 --> 00:34:09,516
{\an2}<i>There is some debate that governments</i>
<i>should sell these as legal ivory,</i>

478
00:34:09,983 --> 00:34:12,152
{\an2}<i>cutting down the illegal</i>
<i>black market trade</i>

479
00:34:12,219 --> 00:34:14,821
{\an2}<i>and sending the profits</i>
<i>back into conservation.</i>

480
00:34:19,092 --> 00:34:21,728
{\an2}<i>The elephant carcass will</i>
<i>be left where it fell.</i>

481
00:34:23,463 --> 00:34:26,600
{\an2}<i>It is likely the community</i>
<i>will return to retrieve the meat.</i>

482
00:34:28,435 --> 00:34:30,470
{\an2}<i>The rest will be left to scavengers.</i>

483
00:34:41,949 --> 00:34:44,618
{\an2}<i>This experience points</i>
<i>to another important element</i>

484
00:34:44,751 --> 00:34:47,087
{\an2}<i>in the ongoing fight</i>
<i>to protect wildlife:</i>

485
00:34:47,487 --> 00:34:49,790
{\an2}<i>Convincing people</i>
<i>who have so little,</i>

486
00:34:50,057 --> 00:34:53,827
{\an2}<i>that wildlife is worth far</i>
<i>more to them alive, than dead.</i>

487
00:34:57,631 --> 00:35:00,901
{\an2}<i>As part of its mission Lewa is</i>
<i>working with the local people</i>

488
00:35:00,968 --> 00:35:02,302
{\an2}<i>to get them to see wildlife</i>

489
00:35:02,603 --> 00:35:05,272
{\an2}<i>and particularly the dollars</i>
<i>that come from tourism</i>

490
00:35:05,606 --> 00:35:06,673
{\an2}<i>as an asset.</i>

491
00:35:07,641 --> 00:35:09,276
{\an2}<i>It starts in the schools.</i>

492
00:35:09,643 --> 00:35:13,614
{\an2}We have some animals never seen
and they wish to see today.

493
00:35:14,281 --> 00:35:17,317
{\an2}Tell me the difference
between a black and white rhino.

494
00:35:17,417 --> 00:35:20,387
{\an2}<i>These students rarely see</i>
<i>or interact with wild animals</i>

495
00:35:20,521 --> 00:35:21,955
{\an2}<i>like elephant or rhino,</i>

496
00:35:22,389 --> 00:35:24,725
{\an2}<i>so they have</i>
<i>no connection to the species</i>

497
00:35:25,993 --> 00:35:28,028
{\an2}<i>Lewa is working</i>
<i>to change that.</i>

498
00:35:30,097 --> 00:35:32,232
{\an2}Is this one a black or white rhino?

499
00:35:33,133 --> 00:35:35,002
{\an2}White rhino.
We are seeing that white rhino

500
00:35:35,068 --> 00:35:37,538
{\an2}have a really big mouth,
a very big head.

501
00:35:37,971 --> 00:35:39,573
{\an2}The world has very few rhinos,

502
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:43,944
{\an2}and rhinos are being killed
by human beings in search of...

503
00:35:45,345 --> 00:35:46,947
{\an2}in search of their horns.

504
00:35:55,989 --> 00:35:57,591
{\an2}How can we protect the animals?

505
00:35:57,724 --> 00:35:59,326
{\an2}Is there anything that we can do?

506
00:36:01,962 --> 00:36:04,164
{\an8}Most of the people
who kill the animals,

507
00:36:04,231 --> 00:36:06,300
{\an8}do they come from China to Lewa?

508
00:36:07,835 --> 00:36:10,604
{\an2}The people who kill
come from our neighbourhood

509
00:36:10,704 --> 00:36:13,507
{\an2}so we need to inform them,
we need to teach them,

510
00:36:13,707 --> 00:36:15,275
{\an2}we also need to report.

511
00:36:15,742 --> 00:36:17,377
{\an2}(speaking local language)

512
00:36:17,511 --> 00:36:19,746
{\an2}CONSERVATION EDUCATION CENTRE

513
00:36:21,348 --> 00:36:23,917
{\an2}Who can guess
which animal is this?

514
00:36:25,285 --> 00:36:26,687
{\an2}Rhino. Very good.

515
00:36:26,987 --> 00:36:32,526
{\an2}This is rhino skeleton,
and we assembled the skeleton.

516
00:36:32,926 --> 00:36:36,697
{\an2}It was shot dead
by someone within our village.

517
00:36:37,497 --> 00:36:39,233
{\an8}And, our main question is,

518
00:36:39,299 --> 00:36:43,504
{\an8}are we happy to see skeletons,
skeletons of animals?

519
00:36:43,570 --> 00:36:45,739
{\an2}Or are we happy to see animals

520
00:36:46,106 --> 00:36:48,742
{\an2}feeding, suckling their young ones.

521
00:36:49,776 --> 00:36:50,944
{\an2}That is my question.

522
00:36:53,380 --> 00:36:56,650
{\an2}<i>Education is just one piece</i>
<i>of reaching out to the community</i>

523
00:36:56,817 --> 00:36:58,852
{\an2}<i>and showing the benefits</i>
<i>of conservation.</i>

524
00:36:59,319 --> 00:37:01,622
{\an2}All of us have touched
computers today,

525
00:37:01,989 --> 00:37:06,994
{\an2}but not every child
or every school in this country

526
00:37:07,127 --> 00:37:08,495
{\an2}have an access to the computer,

527
00:37:08,562 --> 00:37:11,198
{\an2}and therefore the computers
that we have today

528
00:37:11,431 --> 00:37:17,070
{\an2}is all gotten from the animals
that we are seeing today.

529
00:37:28,782 --> 00:37:30,684
{\an2}<i>At the nearby Kilimani school,</i>

530
00:37:31,084 --> 00:37:33,820
{\an2}<i>Lewa's assistance</i>
<i>has made a major difference.</i>

531
00:37:34,555 --> 00:37:36,089
{\an2}Before the intervention of Lewa

532
00:37:36,290 --> 00:37:39,092
{\an2}there was almost nothing.

533
00:37:39,159 --> 00:37:43,130
{\an2}There were old structures,
there was nothing good in place.

534
00:37:43,764 --> 00:37:44,831
{\an2}We were not secure.

535
00:37:44,898 --> 00:37:47,701
{\an2}We feel as if the classrooms
are going to fall on us.

536
00:37:52,606 --> 00:37:54,575
{\an2}Lewa did great things for us.

537
00:38:00,347 --> 00:38:03,050
{\an2}They started with our toilets
and the school fence.

538
00:38:03,717 --> 00:38:05,686
{\an2}The standard of hygiene
has been improved.

539
00:38:06,086 --> 00:38:10,424
{\an2}Minor elements like skin rashes
almost eradicated in our school.

540
00:38:10,524 --> 00:38:13,293
{\an2}We appreciate it is
because of wild animals

541
00:38:13,427 --> 00:38:15,829
{\an2}we are given these
beautiful facilities.

542
00:38:16,163 --> 00:38:20,133
{\an2}This has improved
the life of this community,

543
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:21,668
{\an2}the life of my children.

544
00:38:21,935 --> 00:38:24,004
{\an2}WILDLIFE PROTECTION
AND ENVIRONMENTAL CONSERVATION

545
00:38:24,071 --> 00:38:25,138
{\an2}IS OUR PRIORITY

546
00:38:29,276 --> 00:38:31,011
{\an2}LEWA CLINIC

547
00:38:36,116 --> 00:38:38,352
{\an2}<i>On site healthcare</i>
<i>is another cornerstone</i>

548
00:38:38,418 --> 00:38:40,621
{\an2}<i>of helping local people</i>
<i>connect the dots.</i>

549
00:38:41,321 --> 00:38:43,891
{\an2}<i>If their lives are good</i>
<i>it gives them the reasons</i>

550
00:38:43,957 --> 00:38:45,893
{\an2}<i>to avoid the lure</i>
<i>of the poachers money.</i>

551
00:38:48,228 --> 00:38:50,397
{\an2}AMBULANCE

552
00:39:00,507 --> 00:39:02,576
{\an8}We are here
to offer medical services

553
00:39:02,876 --> 00:39:05,379
{\an8}and do the duomi
to the young children.

554
00:39:06,180 --> 00:39:08,048
{\an2}Lewa sponsors this program

555
00:39:08,248 --> 00:39:12,052
{\an2}for giving the community
medical services.

556
00:39:15,522 --> 00:39:17,724
{\an2}It's very helpful
for us to come to them

557
00:39:17,791 --> 00:39:20,360
{\an2}because for them
to walk to the district hospital,

558
00:39:20,427 --> 00:39:22,896
{\an2}is 59 kilometres away from this place.

559
00:39:23,030 --> 00:39:24,565
{\an2}Yes, it's very far away.

560
00:39:26,867 --> 00:39:29,937
{\an2}Every Friday we make sure we
go to at least one village.

561
00:39:30,571 --> 00:39:32,940
{\an2}To offer them the outreach services,

562
00:39:33,006 --> 00:39:34,942
{\an2}we have revealed
for them medical services.

563
00:39:35,442 --> 00:39:38,378
{\an2}In the case we can't manage
we take them in ambulance

564
00:39:39,112 --> 00:39:40,948
{\an2}either to Lepara or Lewa.

565
00:40:06,874 --> 00:40:08,308
{\an2}<i>For the rangers of Lewa</i>

566
00:40:08,375 --> 00:40:11,912
{\an2}<i>the renewed poaching crisis</i>
<i>is just a small part of their job.</i>

567
00:40:12,913 --> 00:40:15,215
{\an2}<i>The rest of their time</i>
<i>it is rather routine</i>

568
00:40:15,649 --> 00:40:17,551
{\an2}<i>spent on the conservancy grounds,</i>

569
00:40:17,951 --> 00:40:21,088
{\an2}<i>tracking and monitoring</i>
<i>the ever growing rhino population</i>

570
00:40:22,389 --> 00:40:25,926
{\an2}<i>Under their care,</i>
<i>the rhino population is thriving.</i>

571
00:40:28,128 --> 00:40:30,364
{\an2}<i>Since it's inception in 1983,</i>

572
00:40:30,731 --> 00:40:35,369
{\an2}<i>Lewa's rhinos have grown</i>
<i>from a handful to about 140 animals.</i>

573
00:40:36,103 --> 00:40:38,338
{\an2}<i>The program has been so successful</i>

574
00:40:38,539 --> 00:40:40,340
{\an2}<i>that Lewa has been able to contribute</i>

575
00:40:40,407 --> 00:40:42,843
{\an2}<i>more than thirty rhinos</i>
<i>to other conservancies</i>

576
00:40:42,910 --> 00:40:44,411
{\an2}<i>for their breeding programs.</i>

577
00:40:46,113 --> 00:40:49,550
{\an2}<i>And now they have</i>
<i>a new addition to the rhino family.</i>

578
00:40:50,150 --> 00:40:52,953
{\an2}<i>A 28 day old male baby black rhino.</i>

579
00:40:53,353 --> 00:40:55,622
{\an2}This boy was abandoned
by her mother.

580
00:40:56,123 --> 00:40:57,758
{\an2}So she abandoned
him overnight.

581
00:40:57,991 --> 00:41:00,394
{\an2}They studied the baby until morning.

582
00:41:01,628 --> 00:41:05,666
{\an2}The guys, the ranger team
came with him to the boma.

583
00:41:08,902 --> 00:41:11,972
{\an2}<i>Elias is one of 4 rangers</i>
<i>who will share the duties</i>

584
00:41:12,039 --> 00:41:14,141
{\an2}<i>of being the new rhino's</i>
<i>surrogate mother.</i>

585
00:41:16,210 --> 00:41:17,978
{\an2}This little guy is like my kid.

586
00:41:19,613 --> 00:41:22,916
{\an2}When I go back to my village
I talk about the baby rhinos,

587
00:41:24,017 --> 00:41:26,420
{\an2}how I stay there during
the day, overnight.

588
00:41:26,820 --> 00:41:28,388
{\an2}So I give stories.

589
00:41:29,456 --> 00:41:32,726
{\an2}They think it's,
they say its a very funny story.

590
00:41:34,528 --> 00:41:36,230
{\an2}<i>They will guide this little charge</i>

591
00:41:36,430 --> 00:41:38,265
{\an2}<i>through the first</i>
<i>five years of its life.</i>

592
00:41:38,966 --> 00:41:42,870
{\an2}<i>Their goal is to teach him enough</i>
<i>so he can become a wild rhino again.</i>

593
00:41:44,037 --> 00:41:45,439
{\an2}<i>They will have help.</i>

594
00:41:46,373 --> 00:41:49,810
{\an2}<i>Kalifi, this little rhino's</i>
<i>biological brother is here.</i>

595
00:41:50,511 --> 00:41:52,779
{\an2}<i>He too was abandoned</i>
<i>shortly after birth</i>

596
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:54,948
{\an2}<i>and has been under</i>
<i>the care of the rangers.</i>

597
00:42:02,089 --> 00:42:04,491
{\an2}<i>The baby imprinted</i>
<i>over the first few days</i>

598
00:42:04,558 --> 00:42:07,361
{\an2}<i>and now accepts the rangers</i>
<i>as its surrogate mother.</i>

599
00:42:08,061 --> 00:42:11,298
{\an2}<i>He remains close</i>
<i>by their side 24 hours a day.</i>

600
00:42:15,068 --> 00:42:17,838
{\an2}<i>Raising a baby rhino</i>
<i>is a big commitment.</i>

601
00:42:18,472 --> 00:42:20,807
{\an2}<i>It's a lot like raising</i>
<i>a human child.</i>

602
00:42:21,675 --> 00:42:23,010
{\an2}<i>The rangers are up early,</i>

603
00:42:23,076 --> 00:42:25,612
{\an2}<i>to make breakfast</i>
<i>before waking up their charges.</i>

604
00:42:31,885 --> 00:42:34,755
{\an2}<i>In the wild a baby rhino</i>
<i>will stay close to his mother</i>

605
00:42:34,821 --> 00:42:36,089
{\an2}<i>for the first three years.</i>

606
00:42:36,623 --> 00:42:38,625
{\an2}<i>And so the rangers</i>
<i>simulate that.</i>

607
00:42:39,126 --> 00:42:40,794
{\an2}LWC CAPTURE

608
00:42:44,498 --> 00:42:46,500
{\an2}<i>These rangers will be</i>
<i>with this little guy</i>

609
00:42:46,567 --> 00:42:48,235
{\an2}<i>for the next five years.</i>

610
00:42:50,204 --> 00:42:53,307
{\an2}<i>For this short while</i>
<i>the rangers will sleep beside the rhino</i>

611
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:55,075
{\an2}<i>in this specially prepared shelter</i>

612
00:42:55,275 --> 00:42:58,312
{\an2}<i>so they can be sure</i>
<i>the baby stays safe and dry.</i>

613
00:43:05,352 --> 00:43:08,288
{\an2}<i>It will stay there for the first six</i>
<i>or eight months of its life</i>

614
00:43:08,655 --> 00:43:11,391
{\an2}<i>until its big enough</i>
<i>to join the other young rhinos.</i>

615
00:43:12,125 --> 00:43:14,795
{\an2}<i>And they'll be together</i>
<i>until the rhino is about five,</i>

616
00:43:15,229 --> 00:43:17,798
{\an2}<i>when it is ready to be</i>
<i>introduced back into the wild.</i>

617
00:43:27,674 --> 00:43:31,178
{\an2}<i>Like his brother, he will need to learn</i>
<i>everything from the rangers,</i>

618
00:43:33,547 --> 00:43:37,551
{\an2}<i>A wild male rhino has to know</i>
<i>how to mark his territory and defend it.</i>

619
00:43:38,318 --> 00:43:41,021
{\an2}<i>So the lessons</i>
<i>for that skill start right away.</i>

620
00:43:54,034 --> 00:43:57,204
{\an2}<i>Rhinos also need to be taught</i>
<i>how to care for themselves.</i>

621
00:43:57,838 --> 00:43:59,573
{\an2}<i>Their tough skin attracts tics</i>

622
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:01,642
{\an2}<i>and so this little</i>
<i>guy needs to be taught</i>

623
00:44:01,708 --> 00:44:05,045
{\an2}<i>the value of a good mud bath</i>
<i>and other grooming routines.</i>

624
00:44:48,522 --> 00:44:50,657
{\an2}<i>At night the rangers</i>
<i>bring the young rhinos</i>

625
00:44:50,724 --> 00:44:53,660
{\an2}<i>back to the enclosure</i>
<i>for another round of hand feeding.</i>

626
00:45:18,785 --> 00:45:19,887
{\an2}<i>At just one month,</i>

627
00:45:20,153 --> 00:45:22,756
{\an2}<i>this little rhino is</i>
<i>still very dependent</i>

628
00:45:22,923 --> 00:45:25,225
{\an2}<i>and so,</i>
<i>it's back to the sleeping structure</i>

629
00:45:25,292 --> 00:45:27,628
{\an2}<i>with one of the rangers</i>
<i>for a cozy sleep.</i>

630
00:45:35,135 --> 00:45:37,571
{\an2}<i>For the rangers caring</i>
<i>for these little rhinos</i>

631
00:45:37,671 --> 00:45:39,740
{\an2}<i>it's a 24 hour a day job.</i>

632
00:45:40,674 --> 00:45:42,709
{\an2}<i>And that reflects</i>
<i>the level of commitment</i>

633
00:45:42,876 --> 00:45:45,245
{\an2}<i>that all of Lewa's</i>
<i>rangers bring to their job</i>

634
00:45:45,312 --> 00:45:47,014
{\an2}<i>of protecting wildlife.</i>

635
00:45:49,349 --> 00:45:52,019
{\an2}<i>While they see the worst</i>
<i>deaths from illegal poaching,</i>

636
00:45:52,352 --> 00:45:55,689
{\an2}<i>this part of their work,</i>
<i>is a reminder of the real joy</i>

637
00:45:55,789 --> 00:45:59,159
{\an2}<i>that comes from this deep connection</i>
<i>with this incredible species.</i>

638
00:46:00,093 --> 00:46:03,797
{\an2}<i>And it underlines the need</i>
<i>for all the work that goes on at Lewa.</i>

639
00:46:04,898 --> 00:46:06,366
{\an2}<i>Whether it's</i>
<i>conducting research</i>

640
00:46:06,433 --> 00:46:09,136
{\an2}<i>to make sure the range</i>
<i>for these animals is protected,</i>

641
00:46:09,536 --> 00:46:12,105
{\an2}<i>to fostering community</i>
<i>support for wildlife</i>

642
00:46:12,172 --> 00:46:15,475
{\an2}<i>through education,</i>
<i>medical care and job creation,</i>

643
00:46:15,876 --> 00:46:19,446
{\an2}<i>the staff at Lewa</i>
<i>have had real successes so far.</i>

644
00:46:20,280 --> 00:46:23,050
{\an2}<i>But there is still</i>
<i>much more that needs to be done.</i>

645
00:46:24,051 --> 00:46:27,721
{\an2}<i>And for the rangers who do everything</i>
<i>from becoming surrogate mothers</i>

646
00:46:27,855 --> 00:46:31,792
{\an2}<i>to performing like a small military</i>
<i>in the face of renewed rampant poaching</i>

647
00:46:32,159 --> 00:46:33,827
{\an2}<i>the work doesn't stop.</i>

648
00:46:35,696 --> 00:46:39,099
{\an2}<i>At Lewa protecting</i>
<i>wildlife is not just a job.</i>

649
00:46:41,235 --> 00:46:42,503
{\an2}<i>It's a way of life.</i>

650
00:46:44,671 --> 00:46:48,141
{\an2}When I see like 20 rhinos
and today I see that 5 rhinos,

651
00:46:48,208 --> 00:46:51,078
{\an2}and I know definitely we can
make it a thousand of rhinos,

652
00:46:51,144 --> 00:46:55,015
{\an2}we can make it a hundred
thousand of rhinos in this country.

653
00:46:55,115 --> 00:46:59,019
{\an2}So I'm just warning
the people, the poachers

654
00:46:59,119 --> 00:47:00,487
{\an2}to stop poaching

655
00:47:00,621 --> 00:47:03,123
{\an2}and we can turn this country

656
00:47:03,490 --> 00:47:06,360
{\an2}to become something
better than today.

657
00:47:06,493 --> 00:47:09,730
{\an2}But if they don't do that,
we are there to fight with them.

106
00:12:17,236 --> 00:12:21,240
{\an2}You pulled a family of four
out of killer surf, by yourself.

107

{\an2}Just because of you,
they’re still alive.

-She’s in intensive care.

110
00:12:29,665 --> 00:12:32,793
{\an2}She hasn’t regained consciousness.
That’s because of me.

{\an2}A couple of years ago,
I would have saved them all.

112

would take it out of anyone.

{\an2}It wasn’t about being tired.
I’ve been tired before.

114
00:12:47,475 --> 00:12:48,976
{\an2}I made mistakes, Rock.

115
00:12:49,977 --> 00:12:53,231
{\an2}I thought the little girl was caught in
a rip current, she was in the lava tube.

116
00:12:53,314 --> 00:12:57,443
{\an2}I spent most of my time
looking in the wrong place.

117

{\an2}Look at that rock face.

118
00:13:00,112 --> 00:13:01,864
{\an2}Look at the way
the waves break along it.

119

120

{\an2}That’s why the family was sucked in.
How were you to know?

121
00:13:08,788 --> 00:13:11,040
{\an2}You can tell that by just looking at it?

do you want to work my tower?

130
00:14:42,381 --> 00:14:44,967
{\an2}No, no, no. I want to talk to you
about something. Got a minute?

131
00:14:45,051 --> 00:14:47,803
{\an2}Sure. Dave, man, cover my tower.

132
00:14:48,721 --> 00:14:51,557
{\an2}[Mitch] The incident
with that little girl really affected me.

{\an2}-Ignorance kills, right?
-[Rock] Every day.

134
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:57,230
{\an2}[Mitch] Okay. Now, as lifeguards,
how do we learn?

135
00:14:57,313 --> 00:15:01,692
{\an2}We learn from personal experience,
we also learn by talking to each other.

136
00:15:02,735 --> 00:15:06,280
{\an2}Rock, the idea of the center
is a place where lifeguards

137
00:15:06,364 --> 00:15:08,115
{\an2}come from all over the world

138
00:15:08,199 --> 00:15:12,495
{\an2}and they share ideas,
personal experiences, rescue techniques.

139
00:15:13,037 --> 00:15:14,372
{\an2}They learn from each other.

140
00:15:15,623 --> 00:15:18,876
{\an2}You know, if I'd talked to you before
that family was swept off the rocks,

141
00:15:19,669 --> 00:15:21,504
{\an2}I would've handled
that rescue differently.

142
00:15:21,587 --> 00:15:23,256
{\an2}Is this purging off some guilt trip?

143
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:25,508
{\an2}What difference does it make
the motivation here?

144
00:15:25,591 --> 00:15:28,386
{\an2}-It’s about saving lives, okay?
-Okay, don’t bite my head off.

145
00:15:28,469 --> 00:15:32,890
{\an2}Rock, in Australia, last year,
they lost 100 swimmers due to drowning.

146
00:15:32,974 --> 00:15:36,394
{\an2}In Japan, in one weekend alone,
they lost 80 people.

147
00:15:36,477 --> 00:15:39,647
{\an2}That may not have happened if
the lifeguards had talked to each other.

148
00:15:40,273 --> 00:15:42,483
{\an2}All I’m saying is
maybe a little of what you know,

149
00:15:42,567 --> 00:15:46,153
{\an2}combined with a little of what I know
could help solve the problem.

150
00:15:47,613 --> 00:15:50,116
{\an2}I thought about going back to L.A.
and setting it up there,

151
00:15:50,199 --> 00:15:51,784
{\an2}but L.A.’s not the right spot.

152
00:15:51,868 --> 00:15:53,369
{\an2}Conditions are too constant.

153
00:15:54,078 --> 00:15:56,914
{\an2}To train right
in every possible situation:

154
00:15:56,998 --> 00:16:00,251
{\an2}reef breaks, shore breaks,
big surf, flat surf, cliffs.

155
00:16:00,334 --> 00:16:02,879
{\an2}-Hawaii.
-Yeah. Oahu.

156
00:16:03,921 --> 00:16:04,881
{\an2}The North Shore.

157
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:08,676
{\an2}We need a team, Rock.

158
00:16:08,759 --> 00:16:12,013
{\an2}The team should be trained here,
familiar with all kinds of conditions.

159
00:16:12,096 --> 00:16:15,057
{\an2}Well, we could help you with that.
Who else would you involve?

160
00:16:15,141 --> 00:16:18,686
{\an2}Eventually, every lifeguard
in every country in the world.

161
00:16:19,395 --> 00:16:20,897
{\an2}Bring what they do best.

162
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:22,899
{\an2}We take L.A., for example.

163
00:16:23,858 --> 00:16:25,902
{\an2}What do you admire most
about L.A. lifeguards?

164
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:28,654
{\an2}Organization. You guys
have put together a great system.

165
00:16:29,405 --> 00:16:32,700
{\an2}-What about Hawaii?
-We have some great individual water men.

166
00:16:33,242 --> 00:16:37,079
{\an2}You guys also know big surf and
you’ve also perfected the jet ski rescues.

167
00:16:37,163 --> 00:16:40,708
{\an2}I like the Aussies. And
they use those Rubber Boats.

168
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:41,751
{\an2}They’re competitive.

169
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:44,212
{\an2}They'd bring an edge to training.
They hate to lose.

170
00:16:44,295 --> 00:16:48,007
{\an2}-South Africans are pretty innovative.
-Germany and Brazil got lots to offer.

171
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:49,800
{\an2}But we’re getting too big here.

172
00:16:50,801 --> 00:16:54,180
{\an2}We need one team. A small group
of elite individuals.

173
00:16:54,263 --> 00:16:56,933
{\an2}You know, Mitch, I’d really like
to see you make this work.

174
00:16:57,892 --> 00:16:58,893
{\an2}I’ll make it work.

175
00:17:00,061 --> 00:17:02,605
{\an2}All I gotta do is think of that little
girl in the hospital,

176
00:17:02,688 --> 00:17:06,692
{\an2}fighting for her life,
because of my ignorance of conditions.

177
00:17:07,568 --> 00:17:09,278
{\an2}I won’t let that happen again.

178
00:17:15,117 --> 00:17:18,829
{\an2}[Mitch] <i>If I’m going to put together</i>
<i>this team, I gotta get somebody I know.</i>

179
00:17:20,331 --> 00:17:23,167

<i>Get two of the best.</i>

180
00:17:23,251 --> 00:17:25,503
{\an2}<i>JD Darias and...</i>

181
00:17:26,254 --> 00:17:27,630
{\an2}<i>Jessie Owens.</i>

182
00:17:36,889 --> 00:17:40,935
{\an2}You’re drifting, Jessie. Concentrate.
Just don’t stroke. Focus!

183
00:17:41,018 --> 00:17:43,604
{\an2}Agh! I am focused!

184
00:17:43,688 --> 00:17:45,565
{\an2}Now you are, but you weren’t.

185
00:17:45,648 --> 00:17:47,775
{\an2}[sighs] I hate you, JD!

186
00:17:47,859 --> 00:17:51,654
{\an2}Hate the water that’s in front of you.
Hate your own mediocrity. Hate losing.

187
00:17:51,737 --> 00:17:53,906
{\an2}But me? Me, you gotta love.

188
00:17:53,990 --> 00:17:56,742
{\an2}Hey! Why do I ‘gotta’?

189
00:17:56,826 --> 00:17:58,035
{\an2}Because...

190
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:03,082
{\an2}Jessie, my love.
I am making you better.

191
00:18:07,211 --> 00:18:08,546
{\an2}[moans in frustration]

192
00:18:20,141 --> 00:18:21,475
{\an2}So, what do I tell Mitch?

193
00:18:22,185 --> 00:18:23,686
{\an2}Tell him we can’t go.

194
00:18:23,769 --> 00:18:26,105
{\an2}I’m not going to stop training, JD.

195
00:18:26,189 --> 00:18:29,150
{\an2}No distractions, remember?
That was the rule.

196
00:18:29,233 --> 00:18:33,905
{\an2}No excuses.
I’ve got to win this rotten race.

197
00:18:33,988 --> 00:18:35,364
{\an2}Hello?

198
00:18:35,448 --> 00:18:38,659
{\an2}Jessie. The best triathlon
on the planet is, where?

199
00:18:39,368 --> 00:18:42,288
{\an2}That’s right. Maui. And where is Maui?

200
00:18:42,371 --> 00:18:45,333
{\an2}That’s right. Hawaii.
And where does Mitch want us to go?

201
00:18:45,416 --> 00:18:47,793
{\an2}[laughing] Okay, okay!

202
00:18:49,212 --> 00:18:51,005
{\an2}I promise I will have you ready.

203
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:53,090
{\an2}Okay, JD.

204
00:18:53,174 --> 00:18:55,927
{\an2}If you promise, then I’ll go.

205
00:18:56,010 --> 00:18:58,763
{\an2}Great! You know,
there’s something else about Maui.

206
00:18:58,846 --> 00:19:00,181
{\an2}Yeah? What's that?

207
00:19:00,264 --> 00:19:03,976
{\an2}It is, ah, the number one honeymoon
destination spot in the world.

208
00:19:05,603 --> 00:19:07,063
{\an2}Is that a proposal?

209
00:19:08,272 --> 00:19:10,149
{\an2}I don't know... is it?

210
00:19:10,858 --> 00:19:12,860
{\an2}Sure sounds like one to me.

211
00:19:12,944 --> 00:19:14,987
{\an2}Well, what do you think?

212
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:18,157
{\an2}I think that I need to do this race,

213
00:19:18,908 --> 00:19:20,493
{\an2}but then anything’s possible.

about this guy, Sean Monroe?

225
00:20:11,252 --> 00:20:13,504
{\an2}You know him.
He used to be with L.A. County.

226
00:20:13,588 --> 00:20:16,841
{\an2}Yeah, I know. He’s on Kauai, now.
What do the local guys say about him?

227
00:20:16,924 --> 00:20:19,343
{\an2}-Good reputation?
-Yeah. Tough.

228
00:20:19,969 --> 00:20:23,097
{\an2}A loner. Learns quick, though. Why?

229
00:20:24,098 --> 00:20:26,684
{\an2}I’m thinking about choosing him
to run the training center.

{\an2}-Sean Monroe?
-What do you think?

323
00:27:45,456 --> 00:27:47,708
{\an2}-[Allie] Baywatch.
-That's right.

324
00:27:48,543 --> 00:27:50,086
{\an2}Hi, I’m Allie Reese.

325
00:27:50,169 --> 00:27:51,462
{\an2}I'm in love.

326
00:27:52,797 --> 00:27:54,423
{\an2}Oh, ah, what was your name?

327
00:27:54,507 --> 00:27:55,675
{\an2}Jason.

328
00:27:55,758 --> 00:27:58,302
{\an2}-And how old are you, Jason?
-Nineteen.

329
00:27:58,386 --> 00:28:00,471
{\an2}Ah, that’s too young.

330
00:28:00,555 --> 00:28:01,639
{\an2}I'll get older.

331
00:28:01,722 --> 00:28:03,933
{\an2}[laughing] I don’t think
I can wait that long.

332
00:28:04,016 --> 00:28:05,852
{\an2}You have to.
This old crone in Port Arthur

333
00:28:05,935 --> 00:28:08,312
{\an2}said I’d marry the most beautiful
woman in the world.

334
00:28:08,938 --> 00:28:12,108
{\an2}[Jessie] Allie? Oh, my God!

335
00:28:12,191 --> 00:28:13,693
{\an2}I can't believe it!

336
00:28:13,776 --> 00:28:15,111
{\an2}How are you?

337
00:28:15,194 --> 00:28:17,905
{\an2}It’s so good to see you. How is everyone?
How’s Cody and Alex?

338
00:28:17,989 --> 00:28:20,408
{\an2}Good. Just guarding’ the beaches of L.A.

339
00:28:20,491 --> 00:28:23,536
{\an2}JD, this is Allie Reese.
We met in Australia.

340
00:28:23,619 --> 00:28:25,454
{\an2}-Nice to meet you.
-Heard a lot about you.

341
00:28:26,330 --> 00:28:29,959
{\an2}Oh, and this is, um, Jason.
I didn’t catch his last name.

342
00:28:30,042 --> 00:28:30,960
{\an2}Jason's enough.

343
00:28:32,879 --> 00:28:34,964
{\an2}-Hey. Jessie Owens.
-Pleasure.

344
00:28:35,423 --> 00:28:38,634
{\an2}-You coming with us?
-No. You’re coming with me.

345
00:28:41,554 --> 00:28:44,307
{\an2}[upbeat music]

346
00:28:55,151 --> 00:28:55,985
{\an2}Jessie!

347
00:28:58,905 --> 00:29:00,072
{\an2}Jessie?

348
00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:01,574
{\an2}Jessie, let's...

349
00:29:03,534 --> 00:29:04,952
{\an2}go... oh.

350
00:29:08,873 --> 00:29:10,124
{\an2}Jessie’s not here.

351
00:29:10,958 --> 00:29:12,460
{\an2}Yeah, right, ah...

352
00:29:14,670 --> 00:29:17,715
{\an2}You, you, you see,
there’s a meeting, and...

353
00:29:17,798 --> 00:29:19,008
{\an2}Um...

354
00:29:19,091 --> 00:29:20,218
{\an2}Kekoa Tanaka.

355
00:29:20,885 --> 00:29:23,095
{\an2}-Kekoa Tanaka?
-That's my name.

356
00:29:23,179 --> 00:29:24,764
{\an2}Oh, right! JD.

357
00:29:25,389 --> 00:29:26,349
{\an2}Hi.

358
00:29:26,432 --> 00:29:29,644
{\an2}There’s a meeting, JD. You don't
wanna be late on your first day.

359
00:29:29,727 --> 00:29:30,561
{\an2}Right.

360
00:29:47,161 --> 00:29:49,247
{\an2}-Hey!
-Hey, you, muah!

361
00:29:49,330 --> 00:29:51,290
{\an2}-Where you been?
-I’ve been looking for you.

362
00:29:51,374 --> 00:29:52,708
{\an2}-Yeah?
-Yeah.

363
00:29:57,255 --> 00:29:59,131
{\an2}Hey! Are you alright?

364
00:29:59,215 --> 00:30:00,758
{\an2}No! Never better.

365
00:30:00,842 --> 00:30:02,051
{\an2}-Yeah?
-Yeah.

366
00:30:09,642 --> 00:30:10,476
{\an2}Who's that?

367
00:30:11,602 --> 00:30:13,980
{\an2}Oh, ah, one of the Hawaiian lifeguards.

368
00:30:14,730 --> 00:30:19,110
{\an2}Her name’s, ah, Kekoa Tanaka,
or something like that.

369
00:30:20,945 --> 00:30:23,447
{\an2}She’s got an interesting look, huh?
She’s pretty.

370
00:30:24,699 --> 00:30:26,868
{\an2}-You think so?
-Yeah, don't you?

371
00:30:27,702 --> 00:30:30,830
{\an2}Yeah... yeah.
She’s got an interesting look.

372
00:30:33,624 --> 00:30:36,210
{\an2}JD, it’s okay to think
that other girls are pretty.

373
00:30:36,294 --> 00:30:38,504
{\an2}It’s when you act like they’re not
that I get concerned.

374
00:30:39,505 --> 00:30:41,591
{\an2}Jessie, what,
are we going to argue about this?

375
00:30:41,674 --> 00:30:43,217
{\an2}I mean, she’s a pretty girl.

376
00:30:43,926 --> 00:30:46,387
{\an2}She’s a knock out.
She’s Miss All Everything, okay?

377
00:30:47,346 --> 00:30:48,681
{\an2}Okay.

378
00:30:49,682 --> 00:30:50,516
{\an2}Okay.

379
00:30:51,184 --> 00:30:53,186
{\an2}C’mon, I found a place to do laps.

380
00:30:54,228 --> 00:30:57,273
{\an2}There’s no pool, but there’s
some quiet water across the way.

381
00:31:21,756 --> 00:31:24,008
{\an2}Hey, who’s the hapa haole?

382
00:31:24,926 --> 00:31:27,512
{\an2}That’s the kid Roger Lorenz
sent us from Galveston.

383
00:31:27,595 --> 00:31:29,055
{\an2}Says he’s a prodigy.

384
00:31:30,431 --> 00:31:32,099
{\an2}Listen, I’m going to go find Mitch.

385
00:31:37,605 --> 00:31:38,731
{\an2}Say, Cuz.

386
00:31:39,982 --> 00:31:42,693
{\an2}The name’s Jason.
And I ain’t ‘hapa’ anything.

387
00:31:42,777 --> 00:31:45,154
{\an2}Jason. I’m Kai Colburn.

388
00:31:45,238 --> 00:31:48,824
{\an2}And hapa’s not an insult,
it means half, or part.

389
00:31:48,908 --> 00:31:50,785
{\an2}Almost everyone in Hawaii is hapa.

390
00:31:50,868 --> 00:31:53,829
{\an2}That’s you. Me? I’m me.

391
00:31:53,913 --> 00:31:57,208
{\an2}One thing, one piece,
one person, all together.

392
00:31:57,291 --> 00:31:59,085
{\an2}Didn’t mean to hurt your feelings.

393
00:31:59,168 --> 00:32:01,462
{\an2}-You didn't.
-Say, Jason.

394
00:32:02,630 --> 00:32:03,506
{\an2}Yeah, Kai?

395
00:32:03,589 --> 00:32:06,551
{\an2}I’m sure they told you in Texas
about all the sharks we have here.

396
00:32:06,634 --> 00:32:09,345
{\an2}Well, don’t be afraid.
It’s not as bad as you’ve heard.

397
00:32:10,263 --> 00:32:13,224
{\an2}-You trying to get in my head?
-I don’t know. Can I?

398
00:32:13,307 --> 00:32:14,642
{\an2}I don’t know. Can you?

399
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:24,485
{\an2}So, how do you want to handle this first
meeting? Who is gonna say what?

400
00:32:25,570 --> 00:32:27,238
{\an2}I want you to do it all.

401
00:32:27,321 --> 00:32:28,739
{\an2}Mitch, this is your show.

402
00:32:28,823 --> 00:32:32,201
{\an2}You put the money together, set it all up.
I’m basically just kitchen help.

403
00:32:32,285 --> 00:32:34,704
{\an2}Sean, I’ve got responsibilities
back in L.A.

404
00:32:35,454 --> 00:32:36,914
{\an2}I’m sure you can handle it.

405
00:32:36,998 --> 00:32:38,791
{\an2}I’ll be around for advice and counsel.

406
00:32:41,085 --> 00:32:43,171
{\an2}Alright. I won’t let you down.

407
00:32:43,254 --> 00:32:44,755
{\an2}I know you won't.

408
00:32:46,632 --> 00:32:47,717
{\an2}That’s why I picked you.

409
00:32:58,769 --> 00:33:00,104
{\an2}I’m Sean Monroe.

410
00:33:01,522 --> 00:33:05,151
{\an2}Ten years with L.A. County.
Five years here in Hawaii.

411
00:33:06,152 --> 00:33:08,988
{\an2}We’re going to be setting up
a lifeguard training center here.

412
00:33:09,697 --> 00:33:11,949
{\an2}But before we can invite other lifeguards,

413
00:33:12,033 --> 00:33:15,786
{\an2}every member of this team
must know these waters.

414
00:33:15,870 --> 00:33:20,625
{\an2}The beaches, the surf, the rips,
every kind of condition.

415
00:33:21,834 --> 00:33:23,544
{\an2}So, we will train.

416
00:33:24,295 --> 00:33:27,340
{\an2}And we will train
‘til every member of this team

417
00:33:27,423 --> 00:33:30,134
{\an2}is proficient with the equipment
and the area.

418
00:33:31,427 --> 00:33:34,263
{\an2}The training will be difficult
and dangerous.

419
00:33:35,181 --> 00:33:37,850
{\an2}Now, Mitch picked me to head up this team.

420
00:33:38,434 --> 00:33:41,646
{\an2}He picked you to be a part of this team.
I'll say that again.

421
00:33:42,313 --> 00:33:44,690
{\an2}He picked you. I didn’t.

422
00:33:45,733 --> 00:33:48,152
{\an2}So, I’m assuming you must all
be pretty good, huh?

423
00:33:50,530 --> 00:33:53,574
{\an2}Strong swimmers, great lifeguards.

424
00:33:54,325 --> 00:33:55,826
{\an2}Heroes where you’re from, right?

425
00:33:57,036 --> 00:34:00,414
{\an2}Well, I got news for you,
this is the North Shore of Oahu.

426
00:34:01,290 --> 00:34:03,209
{\an2}And while it doesn’t look like much today,

427
00:34:03,292 --> 00:34:06,379
{\an2}the waves here are the biggest
and most dangerous in the world.

428
00:34:07,296 --> 00:34:10,591
{\an2}And understand that everything
about the ocean changes completely

429
00:34:10,675 --> 00:34:12,301
{\an2}when a wave goes over eight feet.

430
00:34:13,052 --> 00:34:15,763
{\an2}And here they don’t stop at eight.
They go well over 30 feet.

431
00:34:15,847 --> 00:34:18,474
{\an2}I’ll say that again. Thirty feet.

432
00:34:19,934 --> 00:34:20,893
{\an2}Does that scare you?

433
00:34:21,561 --> 00:34:23,396
{\an2}-No.
-It should.

434
00:34:25,022 --> 00:34:26,691
{\an2}When you get caught in the drop zone,

435
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:30,361
{\an2}and you will get caught in drop zone,

436
00:34:31,779 --> 00:34:35,449
{\an2}it’s gonna feel like a three story
building dropping right on your head.

437
00:34:37,159 --> 00:34:38,828
{\an2}Now, each of you will have to deal

438
00:34:38,911 --> 00:34:41,372
{\an2}not only with big surf
and adverse conditions,

439
00:34:41,455 --> 00:34:44,667
{\an2}but with death, because people die here.

440
00:34:44,750 --> 00:34:47,211
{\an2}Lifeguards die here.

441
00:34:47,295 --> 00:34:49,338
{\an2}This will be an elite team.

442
00:34:50,756 --> 00:34:54,510
{\an2}Since every team has a weak link,
I’m going to do us all a favor.

443
00:34:55,761 --> 00:34:59,140
{\an2}I’m going to find the weak link
and I’m gonna send them home.

444
00:35:00,641 --> 00:35:03,978
{\an2}Now... if you know
that you’re the weak link,

445
00:35:04,061 --> 00:35:05,271
{\an2}you can do me a favor.

446
00:35:06,606 --> 00:35:07,607
{\an2}Quit now.

447
00:35:16,449 --> 00:35:17,825
{\an2}Training starts tomorrow.

448
00:35:25,291 --> 00:35:26,834
{\an2}Who do you think it’s gonna be?

449
00:35:27,502 --> 00:35:29,921
{\an2}Not me. You’ll go before I will.

450
00:35:30,004 --> 00:35:31,172
{\an2}Really?

451
00:35:31,255 --> 00:35:34,675
{\an2}I’ve never been a weak link in my life
and it’s not gonna start here.

452
00:35:34,759 --> 00:35:36,427
{\an2}I didn’t think it was that serious.

453
00:35:36,511 --> 00:35:39,180
{\an2}You can think about how serious it was
on the plane ride home.

454
00:35:39,263 --> 00:35:41,599
{\an2}Who’s going home? Me?

455
00:35:41,682 --> 00:35:44,560
{\an2}You think it’s me? Forget that.

456
00:35:44,644 --> 00:35:46,729
{\an2}They’ll plant my ass
before they send me home.

457
00:35:49,565 --> 00:35:52,818
{\an2}-So, was I a little over the top?
-I think you got their attention.

458
00:35:53,945 --> 00:35:56,531
{\an2}-You gonna come along?
-No. I got someone I gotta see.

459
00:35:57,281 --> 00:35:58,366
{\an2}Keep up the good work.

460
00:35:58,449 --> 00:36:00,076
{\an2}-You’re doing a good job.
-Thanks.

461
00:36:05,081 --> 00:36:07,959
{\an2}I don’t know if I like this guy.
What’d you know about him?

462
00:36:08,042 --> 00:36:09,126
{\an2}No more than you do.

463
00:36:10,002 --> 00:36:13,172
{\an2}You know, it just seems like he’s trying
to set all of us against one another

464
00:36:13,256 --> 00:36:15,258
{\an2}and Mitch would never do
something like that.

465
00:36:15,341 --> 00:36:19,053
{\an2}He’s a hardass, but he’s right.
There's always a weak link.

466
00:36:19,136 --> 00:36:22,098
{\an2}I’d rather find out during training
than later when it really counts.

467
00:36:23,015 --> 00:36:26,060
{\an2}So what if it’s me and I have to go home?
Are you gonna stay?

468
00:36:26,143 --> 00:36:27,103
{\an2}It’s not gonna be you.

469
00:36:27,186 --> 00:36:29,522
{\an2}You hope it’s not me, so you
don’t have to make that decision.

470
00:36:30,398 --> 00:36:34,151
{\an2}Of course, then if I get sent home,
you get to be here all alone with Kekoa.

471
00:36:34,777 --> 00:36:38,447
{\an2}Jessie, I looked at her, that’s all.
I just looked at her.

472
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:41,200
{\an2}Well, I guarantee you this, JD,

473
00:36:41,284 --> 00:36:42,952
{\an2}I’m not the one going home.

474
00:36:43,035 --> 00:36:45,538
{\an2}Good. Because it’s not going
to be me, either.

475
00:36:46,330 --> 00:36:47,540
{\an2}Good.

476
00:36:58,259 --> 00:36:59,093
{\an2}Sean?

477
00:36:59,719 --> 00:37:02,180
{\an2}I was thinking,
ah, during all this testing,

478
00:37:02,263 --> 00:37:05,016
{\an2}you gonna dance with us
or just watch from the sidelines?

479
00:37:05,099 --> 00:37:05,975
{\an2}A little of both.

480
00:37:06,767 --> 00:37:09,395
{\an2}What if it turned out to be
that you’re the weak link?

481
00:37:10,313 --> 00:37:13,900
{\an2}Well, that’s an interesting thought,
but it’s not possible.

482
00:37:13,983 --> 00:37:15,902
{\an2}But it would be pretty funny.

483
00:37:16,611 --> 00:37:17,945
{\an2}Hysterical.

484
00:37:18,613 --> 00:37:19,614
{\an2}But not possible.

485
00:37:20,615 --> 00:37:21,532
{\an2}No.

486
00:37:21,616 --> 00:37:22,617
{\an2}Good.

487
00:37:43,137 --> 00:37:44,055
{\an2}Hey, Mitch.

488
00:37:44,889 --> 00:37:46,349
{\an2}There’s someone here to see you.

489
00:37:52,980 --> 00:37:54,398
{\an2}[Mitch laughs]

490
00:37:56,192 --> 00:37:57,276
{\an2}Hina!

491
00:37:59,237 --> 00:38:02,406
{\an2}Wow. It’s so nice to finally meet you.

492
00:38:02,949 --> 00:38:04,367
{\an2}This is for you.

493
00:38:07,995 --> 00:38:09,372
{\an2}[Rock] Feathers.

494
00:38:09,455 --> 00:38:11,040
{\an2}Those are for royalty.

495
00:38:11,916 --> 00:38:13,292
{\an2}A medallion, huh?

496
00:38:14,752 --> 00:38:16,963
{\an2}It’s beautiful. Thank you.

497
00:38:17,046 --> 00:38:19,590
{\an2}My mother made it, for saving us.

498
00:38:19,674 --> 00:38:22,552
{\an2}She said to tell you,
each feather lei is unique.

499
00:38:23,135 --> 00:38:24,846
{\an2}There is none like it.

500
00:38:24,929 --> 00:38:27,473
{\an2}It’s as special and unique as you are.

501
00:38:28,266 --> 00:38:31,894
{\an2}Well, Hina, I’m not that special.
I am just a lifeguard doing his job.

502
00:38:31,978 --> 00:38:35,398
{\an2}My mother said to tell you
that as long as you have this lei,

503
00:38:35,481 --> 00:38:37,567
{\an2}your soul will be in our keeping.

504
00:38:37,650 --> 00:38:38,901
{\an2}<i>Mahalo.</i>

505
00:38:43,739 --> 00:38:44,824
{\an2}<i>Mahalo.</i>

506
00:38:47,451 --> 00:38:50,121
{\an2}Oh, don’t forget my birthday party.
You promised to come.

507
00:38:50,204 --> 00:38:52,623
{\an2}I promise I’ll be there.

508
00:38:58,171 --> 00:38:59,088
{\an2}Well...

509
00:39:00,798 --> 00:39:03,217
{\an2}I’ve been thanked in a lot of ways
by a lot of people...

510
00:39:05,094 --> 00:39:07,430
{\an2}but no one has ever promised
to keep my soul.

511
00:39:08,055 --> 00:39:09,348
{\an2}It’s an honor.

512
00:39:09,432 --> 00:39:10,683
{\an2}Welcome to Hawaii.

513
00:39:11,684 --> 00:39:12,727
{\an2}Thanks, bud.

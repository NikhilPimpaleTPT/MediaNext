00:00:13.807 --> 00:00:16.683 align:middle
When you see Joe and you
see him come to work in the rain

2
00:00:16.683 --> 00:00:19.520 align:middle
in cold weather, we're not talking
about just across the street.

3
00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:22.065 align:middle
I mean, where he stays is probably
four or five miles from here,

4
00:00:22.065 --> 00:00:24.233 align:middle
and the guy is
60-something years old.

5
00:00:24.233 --> 00:00:27.112 align:middle
I mean, you can't help but to have
compassion for a guy like that.

6
00:00:31.573 --> 00:00:34.327 align:middle
Joe is our outside custodian.

7
00:00:34.327 --> 00:00:37.580 align:middle
He cleans the building, he's responsible
for keeping our building clean.

8
00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:40.583 align:middle
He's been doing it
for about three years now.

9
00:00:40.583 --> 00:00:42.710 align:middle
He puts his heart
into what he does.

10
00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:46.588 align:middle
When he's finished doing his work
the job looks really good.

11
00:00:46.588 --> 00:00:49.800 align:middle
Joe's a hard-worker.

12
00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.635 align:middle
He had a vehicle when
he first started here

13
00:00:51.635 --> 00:00:53.638 align:middle
and his vehicle's beginning
to give him some problems.

14
00:00:53.638 --> 00:00:55.557 align:middle
It cost him more
to get it fixed

15
00:00:55.557 --> 00:00:57.517 align:middle
than it would be
to purchase another car

16
00:00:57.517 --> 00:00:59.685 align:middle
and he was not able to
afford that at the time.

17
00:00:59.685 --> 00:01:02.980 align:middle
So Joe just started
walking to work.

18
00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:06.525 align:middle
One of our guys won a UPS bike
in one of our drawings

19
00:01:06.525 --> 00:01:09.320 align:middle
and we donated that bike to him.

20
00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:14.492 align:middle
It didn't matter what condition or
weather it was he came on to work.

21
00:01:14.492 --> 00:01:17.287 align:middle
Walking and riding
back and forth to work

22
00:01:17.287 --> 00:01:20.080 align:middle
he has put thousands
and thousands of miles

23
00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:25.587 align:middle
on his feet and on that bicycle
just to be able to get to work.

24
00:01:27.255 --> 00:01:29.632 align:middle
If he's on this back road
– what most of us use –

25
00:01:29.632 --> 00:01:31.342 align:middle
someone is going to
stop and pick him up.

26
00:01:31.342 --> 00:01:33.343 align:middle
Even though he's
pedaling that bicycle.

27
00:01:33.343 --> 00:01:35.597 align:middle
He's going to make it to work.

28
00:01:35.597 --> 00:01:38.808 align:middle
So we just decided,
he didn't need to be walking.

29
00:01:38.808 --> 00:01:41.435 align:middle
So we all got together
and started taking up money

30
00:01:41.435 --> 00:01:44.355 align:middle
and me, being the money lady,
I just grab me an envelope

31
00:01:44.355 --> 00:01:46.273 align:middle
and started telling every driver
I said, "Look,

32
00:01:46.273 --> 00:01:49.527 align:middle
you all need to give
money to help Mr. Joe out."

33
00:01:49.527 --> 00:01:52.655 align:middle
I looked for Joe a car
for about a month or so

34
00:01:52.655 --> 00:01:55.825 align:middle
and I found a few cars
and drove them up here

35
00:01:55.825 --> 00:01:58.243 align:middle
and we finally found Joe a car.

36
00:01:58.243 --> 00:02:01.497 align:middle
My role was to make sure
everything was in good shape

37
00:02:01.497 --> 00:02:04.375 align:middle
so whenever he got it
he wouldn't have any problems.

38
00:02:04.375 --> 00:02:06.502 align:middle
It should just last him a while.

39
00:02:06.502 --> 00:02:08.630 align:middle
Now, we wanted to surprise Joe

40
00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:11.883 align:middle
and give Joe the car
as a gift from the center.

41
00:02:11.883 --> 00:02:14.968 align:middle
He told me,
"Won't you come in early?

42
00:02:14.968 --> 00:02:17.138 align:middle
And we'll just have your breakfast."

43
00:02:17.138 --> 00:02:22.102 align:middle
And so I didn't know that he
was going to surprise me.

44
00:02:22.102 --> 00:02:24.645 align:middle
I get goosebumps
thinking about the fact

45
00:02:24.645 --> 00:02:26.772 align:middle
that when we gave him
the car he cried.

46
00:02:26.772 --> 00:02:30.985 align:middle
The first thing Joe said when
he seen the car was, "Oh, man."

47
00:02:30.985 --> 00:02:34.072 align:middle
I thought Joe was fixing
to have a heart attack out here.

48
00:02:34.072 --> 00:02:37.950 align:middle
This moment I have that
they gave me, I'll never forget it.

49
00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:42.705 align:middle
As a matter of fact, it was the best
moment of my whole entire life.

50
00:02:42.705 --> 00:02:44.290 align:middle
I do want to say this right here:

51
00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:46.625 align:middle
it's a the testament
to leadership here.

52
00:02:46.625 --> 00:02:49.962 align:middle
Because without the leadership
this would never happen.

53
00:02:49.962 --> 00:02:54.008 align:middle
It's a group effort. Because, you know,
we can do things individually,

54
00:02:54.008 --> 00:02:57.512 align:middle
but when we're united as one,
we can do more.

55
00:02:57.512 --> 00:03:01.015 align:middle
We got Joe a car
and presented it to him

56
00:03:01.015 --> 00:03:03.810 align:middle
and ever since then,
Joe's parked his bike

57
00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:07.313 align:middle
and he's been riding home
four wheels instead of two.
